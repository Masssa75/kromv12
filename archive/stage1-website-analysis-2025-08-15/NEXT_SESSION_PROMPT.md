# Next Session Prompt: Website Analysis Stage 1 System

## 🎯 Current Status (August 15, 2025)

You are continuing work on the **Stage 1 Website Analysis Triage System** for crypto tokens. The system is **95% complete** but has one critical issue to resolve before running the full batch of 304 utility tokens.

## ✅ What's Working Perfectly:

### 1. **Stage 1 Assessment Framework**
- **1-3 scoring scale** across 7 categories (vs old 1-10 scale)
- **Smart thresholds**: 10+ points = Proceed to Stage 2, <10 = Skip
- **Balanced evaluation**: No longer over-weights team transparency

### 2. **Complete UI System** - http://localhost:5006
- **List view** showing all analyzed tokens with scores/tiers
- **Modal detail view** with visual meters (exactly like user requested)
- **Green/red signal boxes** for exceptional signals and missing elements
- **Natural language assessments** explaining decisions
- **Working clickable modals**

### 3. **AI Analysis Pipeline**
- Uses **Kimi K2** ($0.003/analysis, 10x cheaper than alternatives)
- **Playwright parsing** with JavaScript rendering (5x more content)
- **Stage 2 link identification** - AI suggests which links to deep parse
- **Database integration** - All results saved with proper tickers

## 🔴 Critical Issue to Fix:

**MSIA shows all 0/3 scores** (as seen in user's screenshot) but should have realistic scores. The problem is inconsistent category score data in the database.

### Current Status:
- **GAI**: Has proper scores and signals ✅
- **MSIA**: All 0/3 scores (incorrect) ❌
- **STRAT**: Has proper scores ✅
- **REX**: Has proper scores ✅

## 🔧 Immediate Fix Needed:

The issue is that some tokens have `category_scores` JSON but individual score columns are NULL/0. The API tries to use individual columns first, falling back to JSON.

**Files to check:**
- `/temp-website-analysis/fixed_results_server.py` (lines 604-620) - API parsing logic
- Database: `website_analysis_new.db` - Check MSIA's category_scores vs individual columns

**Quick debug:**
```sql
SELECT ticker, score_technical_infrastructure, category_scores 
FROM website_analysis WHERE ticker = 'MSIA';
```

## 📋 Tasks for Next Instance:

### 1. **IMMEDIATE (5 minutes)**
- Debug why MSIA shows 0/3 for all categories
- Fix the API parsing logic to properly handle category scores
- Verify all 4 test tokens show realistic scores in UI

### 2. **READY TO EXECUTE (after fix)**
- Remove lines 184-188 from `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` 
- Run full batch: `python3 batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py`
- Process all **304 utility tokens** from Supabase
- **Cost**: ~$0.91 (304 × $0.003)

### 3. **Post-Batch**
- Analyze results: How many qualify for Stage 2?
- Identify tokens with highest scores for manual review
- Plan Stage 2 deep analysis system

## 🗂️ Key Files:

### Analysis System:
- `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` - Main analyzer (updated prompt)
- `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` - Batch processor for 304 tokens
- `fixed_results_server.py` - UI server on port 5006

### Database:
- `website_analysis_new.db` - Local results (4 test tokens)
- Supabase `crypto_calls` - Source of 304 utility tokens

### Current UI:
- **Working**: http://localhost:5006
- **Features**: List + modal with meters, signals, assessments

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made:

1. **1-3 Scale**: Faster triage, exceptional signals (like Apple backing) = instant 3
2. **Balanced Prompt**: 7 categories ~15% each, team transparency no longer dominant
3. **Stage 2 Links**: AI identifies which links to deep parse (GitHub, docs, etc.)
4. **UI Design**: List view + modal (not standalone cards) per user preference
5. **Cost Optimization**: Kimi K2 only (10x cheaper, still accurate)

## 🚀 Expected Outcome:

After fixing MSIA's scores and running the batch:
- **~304 tokens analyzed** in Stage 1
- **~30-60 tokens** likely to qualify for Stage 2 (10+ points)
- **Clear pipeline** for Stage 2 deep analysis
- **UI showing** all results with proper scoring

## ❓ Questions for User:

1. **After fixing MSIA**: Ready to run the full 304 token batch?
2. **Stage 2 planning**: What depth of analysis for qualifying tokens?
3. **Results review**: Manual review of high-scoring tokens first?

---

**CRITICAL**: Fix MSIA's 0/3 scores first, then proceed with batch. The system is otherwise complete and ready for production use.

**Context**: This Stage 1 system will be the foundation for a two-stage analysis pipeline - Stage 1 for rapid triage, Stage 2 for deep investigation of promising tokens.
