# Stage 1 Website Analysis Triage System - Archive

**Date**: August 15, 2025
**Status**: 95% Complete - Ready for production batch after fixing MSIA UI issue

## System Overview

Stage 1 Website Analysis Triage System using 1-3 scoring across 7 balanced categories to replace team-biased 1-10 system. Features visual meter UI and automated Stage 2 recommendations.

## Files Archived

- `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` - Main analyzer with balanced prompt
- `fixed_results_server.py` - UI server with meters and signal boxes
- `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` - Ready to process 304 utility tokens
- `website_analysis_new.db` - Database with 4 test tokens analyzed
- `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` - Complete handoff documentation

## Key Achievements

1. **Balanced Scoring**: 7 categories @ ~15% each (vs 50% team transparency)
2. **Visual UI**: List view + clickable modals with category meters
3. **Cost Optimization**: Kimi K2 only ($0.003/analysis, 10x cheaper)
4. **Production Ready**: Batch processor for 304 tokens (~$0.91 total cost)

## Outstanding Issue

MSIA token shows 0/3 for all categories in UI modal despite having data. Issue is in API parsing logic (lines 604-620 in fixed_results_server.py).

## Next Steps

1. Debug MSIA category score display
2. Run full batch: `python3 batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py`
3. Analyze results for Stage 2 candidates

## UI Access

- Local server: `python3 fixed_results_server.py` â†’ http://localhost:5006
- Features: Sortable list, clickable modals, meter visualization, signal boxes

This system forms the foundation for a two-stage analysis pipeline:
- **Stage 1**: Rapid triage (1-3 scoring) 
- **Stage 2**: Deep investigation of high-scoring tokens (10+ points)
