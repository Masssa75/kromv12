# Price Accuracy Fix Summary

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Missing ROI (Fixed ✅)
- **Problem**: 5,267 tokens (95.3%) had both prices but no ROI calculated
- **Solution**: SQL update to calculate ROI for all tokens with both prices
- **Result**: Fixed 5,266 tokens

### 2. GeckoTerminal Pool Selection Bug (Fixed ✅)
- **Problem**: Code was selecting pool with highest price instead of highest liquidity
- **Root Cause**: `if (poolPrice > bestPrice)` logic in refresh-prices endpoint
- **Impact**: Caused massive price inflation (some tokens showing 24M% ROI)
- **Solution**: Changed to sort pools by liquidity and select the most liquid pool
- **Result**: Price accuracy improved from ~20% wrong to <5% wrong

### 3. Inflated Prices Cleanup (Fixed ✅)
- **Problem**: 14 tokens had astronomical ROI (>10,000%) due to wrong prices
- **Solution**: Reset dead tokens to null, fetched correct prices for active ones
- **Result**: 12 tokens fixed, ROI distribution now realistic

## Current State
- Most tokens now show correct prices (within 10% of API)
- ROI distribution is realistic:
  - 491 tokens with ROI < -90% (expected for crypto)
  - 138 tokens with ROI between -50% and 100%
  - Only 10 tokens with ROI > 1000% (down from many more)

## Examples of Fixed Tokens
- **FINESHYT**: Was +2,963% → Now -95.3% ✅
- **OZZY**: Was +243% → Now -89.6% ✅
- **BIP177**: Was wrong → Now -97.0% ✅
- **LOA**: Was 3,278% off → Now +86.9% ✅
- **3BAI**: Was 2,273% off → Now -24.0% ✅

## Technical Fix Applied
```typescript
// OLD (WRONG)
if (poolPrice > bestPrice) {
  bestPrice = poolPrice;
}

// NEW (CORRECT)
const sortedPools = pools.sort((a, b) => {
  const liquidityA = parseFloat(a.attributes?.reserve_in_usd || '0');
  const liquidityB = parseFloat(b.attributes?.reserve_in_usd || '0');
  return liquidityB - liquidityA;
});
const bestPrice = sortedPools[0].attributes?.token_price_usd;
```

The fix is already deployed in the refresh-prices endpoint.
