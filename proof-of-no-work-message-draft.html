            <div class="section-title">Opening</div>
            <p>Hey PoNW, sorry for the delay. But I think in order for us to move forward in the right direction you need to understand exactly where we stand, so this has to be very comprehensive and therefore took a lot of time.</p>
            
            <p>In this update, I'll cover: 1) What happened with the Forge - all the pivots, decisions, and why we made them, 2) The game-changing breakthrough I've had with AI coding over the past few months and the advantage this gives us, 3) The specific projects I'm working on right now that could take off because of this tech, and 4) How the Forge community members will benefit from each of these opportunities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Background</div>
            <p>Let me start with the background...</p>
            
            <p>When we launched the Forge, we immediately started building what we set out to create. But we quickly realized the first problem wasn't building the fundraising infrastructure - it was getting quality projects to sign up and be rated. Our plan was to onboard projects first, then build the fundraising functionality once we had projects ready to raise. No point solving problem B if we can't solve problem A.</p>
            
            <p>We built the platform - rating system, review mechanisms, everything ready for projects to sign up. Then we launched multiple initiatives to attract projects, including those incubation streams you participated in. We tried two main strategies: getting projects natively from PulseChain and recruiting from outside.</p>
            
            <p>The native approach hit several walls. First, there wasn't much interest from the PulseChain community itself in building projects. Second, the projects that did show up either weren't good enough or never made it to fundraising stage. This isn't unique to us - 9 out of 10 startups fail due to legal, technical, or organizational issues. We had discussions with several projects, some signed up, but none actually made it through to proper review or fundraising.</p>
            
            <p>Looking outside PulseChain presented different challenges. Good projects are already rare in crypto. When I found them, convincing them to come to PulseChain was difficult. Convincing them to use a platform that had only raised $200k for itself was even harder. The only serious project we managed to get was The SH*T, which had invested nearly $100k in development but ultimately decided not to attempt a fundraiser on PulseChain/Forge.</p>
            
            <p>Then the entire market shifted. In previous cycles, utility projects and serious builds got attention. But Pump.fun changed everything - they made $600M in fees while Fjord Foundry (the top decentralized launchpad for serious projects) made only $20M total, then dropped to zero volume for months. Even legitimate projects were forced to launch through Pump.fun because that's where all the volume was.</p>
            
            <p>The message was clear: 99% of activity moved to memecoins, but the key insight was WHY. Pump.fun succeeded because of zero friction - you put money in, it's immediately in the market and trading. No waiting, no lockups, no complex processes. This instant gratification is apparently the only thing the current crypto market cares about.</p>
            
            <p>Compare that to traditional launchpads where projects need extensive preparation, investors lock funds for months or even years waiting for vesting - it's extremely high friction for both sides. Projects need to be far more serious and organized, investors need to be far more patient. In this market environment, our original vision of a high-barrier, curated launchpad simply wouldn't work. We'd never get the traction needed, neither from projects nor investors.</p>
            
            <p>This realization hit around June 2024 - we needed to match the market's demand for instant, frictionless trading while somehow maintaining our vision of supporting real development. So we decided to pivot to a Pump.fun style model but with improvements: 24-hour fundraisers, immediate trading, plus a tax mechanism to fund ongoing development. Importantly, we kept our rating and review mechanism - this really sets us apart from any other platform. The mechanism is quite sophisticated, working with the NFTs for verification. This is something truly unique, but we knew we had to make it fun, easy, and quick like Pump.fun.</p>
            
            <p>Development should have taken weeks but stretched to months due to team issues. Version 1 (without tax) finally launched in November 2024. We got some traction - external people created tokens, which was encouraging. However, at that point we started having many internal organizational issues. I personally hit severe burnout - for 1-2 months I couldn't do anything, which I've mentioned to you before. It was really challenging.</p>
            
            <p>On top of that, Version 2 with the tax mechanism and DEX integration turned out to be far more complicated than expected. I almost thought the team wouldn't be able to pull it off. But it finally launched and actually works flawlessly as of March 2025.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">AI Coding Discovery</div>
            <p>But by then, I had discovered something much bigger. When Version 2 launched in March, that coincided with Gemini 2.5's release, which really catapulted what AI coding could do. I immediately saw the opportunity because we had the launchpad ready.</p>
            
            <p>Here's why AI coding is such a huge deal: All those projects that would've launched on the Forge were tech projects. Below $100k raised, you can't even develop a serious prototype. The core problem in crypto is that developing real tech costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, needs constant testing and iteration - exactly what the Forge has been facing.</p>
            
            <p>AI coding changes everything. It slashes costs from $100k+ for a prototype to literally under $1k. This is why utility tokens weren't working - projects needed to raise far more than they realistically could. The barrier to entry was impossibly high, and public expectations didn't match the reality of development costs.</p>
            
            <p>With AI coding making these 99.5% cost reductions, suddenly everything makes sense. On a Forge-style launchpad, you can raise just $3-5k and build your entire prototype. Have it running in days. With token integration built in. This opportunity literally didn't exist a few months ago.</p>
            
            <p>I realized I had to fully immerse myself in AI coding to understand its potential. So I spent the last 3-4 months diving deep, and I believe I'm now at the forefront of it. (This was actually a major friction point - our dev team was very resistant to AI coding.)</p>
            
            <p>The opportunity is clear: a platform for AI-coded apps. After months of deep diving, I believe we have the knowledge to teach others and build advanced apps incredibly quickly.</p>
            
            <p>I've taken this vision and created RocketApps - essentially the Forge evolved for the AI coding era. The tokenomics work perfectly for AI-coded apps. You can check out the prototype at demo.rocketapps.ai</p>
            
            <p>I've been getting interest from organizations, marketing companies, and chains to work with this.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Chain Considerations & CTO Discussion</div>
            <p>So where does this leave us?</p>
            
            <p>Based on my experience with the Forge, I don't think we'll get creators on PulseChain. Over the past year, I couldn't find PulseChain natives who wanted to build, and I couldn't convince outsiders to build on PulseChain.</p>
            
            <p>I've spent the last few months working on partnerships with crypto marketing and incubator companies. Progress is good but might take more time. I'm in discussions with several chains about RocketApps, and I believe our chances are better there. The prototype runs on Base, and we're exploring opportunities with another chain that's planning a major campaign.</p>
            
            <p>The Forge community members will benefit proportionally regardless of which chain we launch on.</p>
            
            <p>This brings me to your CTO offer. If you like this concept and think you could make it work on PulseChain - if you could promote it, get people on there, lead it - I'd be happy to support. I could go on streams, educate people on how to effectively AI code, bring some of my own projects. But it would depend heavily on your help and leadership because I personally doubt I can generate the serious traction it needs on PulseChain.</p>
            
            <p>So that's what I'd like to discuss with you. If not this approach, what were your ideas? What would you want to do with a community takeover? I'm open to discussing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">AI Coding Breakthrough</div>
            <p>I don't know how familiar you are with AI coding yet, so let me share what I've discovered over the past few months.</p>
            
            <p>When you really get deep into AI coding, you can build almost anything in a very short amount of time - far beyond what you can do with surface-level tools like Lovable. The possibilities are incredible. But debugging has been a nightmare. Sometimes you hit a small bug that takes days and hundreds of prompts to fix. This has been the biggest challenge in AI coding.</p>
            
            <p>I've been working intensely on this problem and developed several protocols. The biggest breakthrough - I can now have AI code autonomously. It tests live apps, finds bugs, fixes them, deploys, tests again. All without asking me anything until the feature actually works. This solves the debugging problem that stops most people.</p>
            
            <p>We're also developing protocols for security (so apps can't be hacked) and scaling. But the key point is we've figured out how to let AI do things I haven't seen anyone else achieve.</p>
            
            <p>This is something we can teach. We could even teach the community to create AI-coded apps. You can now create apps, smart contracts, everything that works out of the box in just days. It took me months to get here, but I now know exactly which tools and protocols make this possible.</p>
            
            <p>I'd be happy to have a call to share some of these tools and protocols with you. I believe AI coding will explode - what I'm doing today, everyone will be able to do with off-the-shelf tools in 6-18 months. But right now, we're at the forefront with our tools and protocols.</p>
            
            <p>This context is important because it explains what we've been doing the past few months, why RocketApps has such potential, and influences the other projects I'll mention next.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">Other Projects</div>
            <p>First is KROM - you might remember I mentioned it in an update months ago. We built the initial version with traditional coding, but now with AI coding we can add incredible features very quickly. With the market picking up, I think the timing is perfect. I'm actually planning to put most of my efforts into KROM for the next few weeks.</p>
            
            <p>KROM monitors hundreds of the most highly ranked call groups on Telegram. We analyze these calls with AI and send instant notifications when high-quality calls come in (currently to a private Telegram group). KROM called TST at 50k market cap and KEETA at 3M market cap - who wouldn't want to join that group?</p>
            
            <p>With AI coding, I'm planning to add:
            - Dexscreener monitoring and AI analysis for important signals with instant notifications
            - Following any crypto project and alerting on important tweets
            - Token-gated features for premium access
            - Referral rewards to grow the community</p>
            
            <p>We've also built a KOL leaderboard that I think will go viral - top KOLs will want to share it once we have good traction.</p>
            
            <p>Several of these features are already built and just need to be released. The rest can be built in days with AI coding. I think KROM can become the central information hub for this crypto cycle. My plan is to airdrop a percentage of supply to the community at certain market cap milestones (without announcing them to avoid dumps).</p>
            
            <p>The second project is a Cyrator-inspired app for parents (no name yet). I have social media channels with 2.5 million total followers (including a YouTube channel with 2M subscribers that I co-founded) focused on education and parenting content. These channels would likely be excited to promote this app. As a parent myself with many parent friends, this is something I've wanted to build for a long time. AI coding finally made it possible - I've already coded about half of it. With these existing audiences, this is really low-hanging fruit for getting traction.</p>
            
            <p>The Forge community would benefit proportionally from any of these projects that succeed. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and questions - happy to get on a call to show you my AI coding protocols or discuss any of this in more detail.</p>
