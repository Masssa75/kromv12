# KROM Session Logs - August 2025

## August 19, 2025 (Session 1) - Website Analysis Integration & UI Enhancements

### Overview
Successfully integrated the website analysis system into the KROM crypto monitoring pipeline. Updated the scoring system to use standard TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA tiers, enhanced UI settings for granular control, and prepared for orchestrator integration.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. Database Migration
- **Constraint Update**: Dropped old HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW constraint and added TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA
- **Data Migration**: Successfully updated 8 existing tokens from old tier names to new
- **SQL Executed**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE crypto_calls SET website_tier = CASE 
    WHEN website_tier = 'LOW' THEN 'TRASH'
    WHEN website_tier = 'MEDIUM' THEN 'BASIC'
    WHEN website_tier = 'HIGH' THEN 'SOLID'
  END WHERE website_tier IN ('LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH');
  ```

#### 2. Edge Function Updates
- **Function**: `crypto-website-analyzer` 
- **Changes**: Updated AI prompt to output TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA tiers
- **Tier Mapping**:
  - 0-7 points → TRASH
  - 8-14 points → BASIC
  - 15-20 points → SOLID
  - 21 points → ALPHA
- **Token Classification**: Removed "hybrid" option, now only "meme" or "utility"

#### 3. UI Enhancements
- **Settings Modal Improvements**:
  - Added separate toggles for scores vs tier badges
  - Two sections: "Analysis Types" and "Display Options"
  - Users can show scores only, badges only, both, or neither
  - Settings persist in localStorage
  
- **Display Standardization**:
  - Website scores now display as 0-10 (converted from 0-21 internally)
  - All tier badges use consistent colors
  - Fixed duplicate token type badges
  - Social filters default to unchecked (showing all)

#### 4. Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Duplicate token type badges appearing
- **Fixed**: Website tiers showing "LOW" instead of "TRASH"
- **Fixed**: Social filters showing selected but not filtering
- **Fixed**: Missing tier mapping function after Edge Function update

## August 15, 2025 (Later Session) - Website Analysis with Kimi K2 Optimization

### Overview
Optimized the comprehensive website analyzer to use Kimi K2 exclusively after discovering it's 10x cheaper ($0.003 vs $0.03+) while maintaining accuracy. Fixed UI display issues and prepared batch processing for 304 utility tokens from Supabase.

### Technical Implementation

#### Kimi K2 Validation
- Tested Kimi K2 with parsed website content (previously it tried direct browsing)
- Results proved accurate: correctly identified 8 team members for GAI, 10 for TRWA
- Scores aligned with other models when given parsed content
- Decision: Use Kimi K2 exclusively for cost efficiency

#### Database and UI Fixes
1. **Fixed N/A ticker display**:
   - Issue: API was trying to JOIN with non-existent `tokens` table
   - Solution: Modified `comprehensive_results_server.py` to read ticker directly from `website_analysis` table
   - Updated all existing records with correct tickers from Supabase

2. **Populated missing analysis details**:
   - Issue: Manual save function only stored basic data (score, no reasoning)
   - Solution: Re-analyzed tokens with full analysis pipeline
   - Updated database with reasoning, technical_depth, team_transparency fields

#### Batch Analyzer Setup
Created `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` that:
- Pulls utility tokens from Supabase (where `analysis_token_type = 'utility'`)
- Found 308 unique websites (304 still to analyze)
- Orders by liquidity (highest first)
- Saves ticker information with analyses
- Estimated cost: $0.91 for all 304 sites

### Key Discoveries

#### Analysis Prompt Bias
Current prompt in `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` is too heavily weighted on team transparency:
- Most tokens score 2-3/10 simply for lacking visible teams
- Binary scoring: 7/10 with team, 2-3/10 without
- Missing evaluation of technical infrastructure, documentation, tokenomics

#### Actual Token Counts
- Supabase has 308 unique utility token websites (not 128 as in local SQLite)
- Identified using `analysis_token_type` OR `x_analysis_token_type = 'utility'`
- 80 tokens where both AIs agree it's utility
- 220 where only call analysis says utility
- 112 where only X analysis says utility

### Files Modified
- `comprehensive_results_server.py` - Fixed ticker display, now reads from local table
- `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` - Defaults to Kimi K2 only
- `update_existing_records.py` - Script to populate missing tickers
- `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` - Production batch analyzer with liquidity ordering

### Production Ready
- ✅ UI displays tickers correctly
- ✅ Batch analyzer configured for Kimi K2 ($0.003/site)
- ✅ 304 utility token websites ready to analyze
- ✅ Estimated 1.5 hours to complete full batch
- ⚠️ Need to refine scoring prompt for better balance

### Next Steps
1. Run batch analysis on 304 utility tokens
2. Refine prompt to reduce team transparency bias
3. Consider weighted scoring across all factors
4. Add progress tracking to batch analyzer

## August 19, 2025 (Session 2) - Website Analysis Orchestrator Integration & Parallelization

### Session Overview
Successfully integrated website analysis into the crypto monitoring orchestrator pipeline, fixing critical issue where notification decisions were made before complete analysis. Parallelized website batch processing to handle up to 5 tokens simultaneously.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Fixed Website Analyzer Edge Function
- **Issue**: JSON parsing error - AI response was being double-parsed
- **Solution**: Added proper JSON handling with markdown code block stripping
- **Tier Update**: Verified TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA system working correctly
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to `crypto-website-analyzer`

#### 2. Website Analysis Testing Results
Successfully analyzed multiple tokens with consistent scoring:
- **VANTUM**: 9/21 (BASIC, utility) - Privacy-focused DeFi solution
- **PROTO**: 8/21 (BASIC, utility) - Decentralized infrastructure  
- **IRIS**: 7/21 & 6/21 (TRASH, utility) - Multiple versions
- **JAKPOT**: 4/21 (TRASH, utility)
- **Meme tokens**: Consistently scored 1-3/21 (TRASH tier)
  - NEKO, SCAN, THEND, SALLY, PCRYPTO, PEPE, BORIS, PICKLE

#### 3. Parallelized Batch Processing
**Before**: Sequential processing, 3 tokens, ~60 seconds
**After**: Parallel processing with optimizations:
- Processes 5 tokens simultaneously (matches KROM poller intake)
- 45-second timeout per website (increased from 30s)
- Total execution: ~45-47 seconds for all 5
- Uses `Promise.allSettled()` for robust error handling

#### 4. Orchestrator Integration
Added website analysis as Step 3 in orchestrator flow:
1. Poll for new calls → 2. Call/X Analysis (parallel) → **3. Website Analysis** → 4. Notifications

This ensures complete data before notification decisions, preventing premature 'notified' marking.

#### 5. Critical Issue Discovery & Resolution
**Problem**: When 5 new tokens arrive but only 3 get website analysis, notifier makes permanent decisions on incomplete data.
**Solution**: Parallelized all 5 tokens, ensuring complete analysis before notifications.

### Retry Logic Analysis

Discovered inconsistent retry patterns across analyzers:
- **Call Analysis**: Sets `score = 5` on failure (no retries)
- **X Analysis**: Leaves DB untouched (infinite retries)
- **Website Analysis**: Currently infinite retries (matches X pattern)

**Options for next session**:
1. Keep current behavior (infinite retries)
2. Add retry limit with counter
3. Mark as failed after timeout
4. Smart retry with exponential backoff

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-website-analyzer/index.ts` - Fixed JSON parsing
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-website-analyzer-batch/index.ts` - Parallelized
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-orchestrator-with-x/index.ts` - Added website step
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-notifier-complete/index.ts` - Added website data

### Performance Metrics
- Website analysis success rate: ~80%
- Processing time: ~45 seconds for 5 websites
- Orchestrator total time: ~55-60 seconds with website analysis
