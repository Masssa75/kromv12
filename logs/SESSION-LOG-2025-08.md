# KROM Session Logs - August 2025

## August 19, 2025 (Session 1) - Website Analysis Integration & UI Enhancements

### Overview
Successfully integrated the website analysis system into the KROM crypto monitoring pipeline. Updated the scoring system to use standard TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA tiers, enhanced UI settings for granular control, and prepared for orchestrator integration.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. Database Migration
- **Constraint Update**: Dropped old HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW constraint and added TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA
- **Data Migration**: Successfully updated 8 existing tokens from old tier names to new
- **SQL Executed**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE crypto_calls SET website_tier = CASE 
    WHEN website_tier = 'LOW' THEN 'TRASH'
    WHEN website_tier = 'MEDIUM' THEN 'BASIC'
    WHEN website_tier = 'HIGH' THEN 'SOLID'
  END WHERE website_tier IN ('LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH');
  ```

#### 2. Edge Function Updates
- **Function**: `crypto-website-analyzer` 
- **Changes**: Updated AI prompt to output TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA tiers
- **Tier Mapping**:
  - 0-7 points → TRASH
  - 8-14 points → BASIC
  - 15-20 points → SOLID
  - 21 points → ALPHA
- **Token Classification**: Removed "hybrid" option, now only "meme" or "utility"

#### 3. UI Enhancements
- **Settings Modal Improvements**:
  - Added separate toggles for scores vs tier badges
  - Two sections: "Analysis Types" and "Display Options"
  - Users can show scores only, badges only, both, or neither
  - Settings persist in localStorage
  
- **Display Standardization**:
  - Website scores now display as 0-10 (converted from 0-21 internally)
  - All tier badges use consistent colors
  - Fixed duplicate token type badges
  - Social filters default to unchecked (showing all)

#### 4. Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Duplicate token type badges appearing
- **Fixed**: Website tiers showing "LOW" instead of "TRASH"
- **Fixed**: Social filters showing selected but not filtering
- **Fixed**: Missing tier mapping function after Edge Function update

### Technical Details

## August 15, 2025 (Later Session) - Website Analysis with Kimi K2 Optimization

### Overview
Optimized the comprehensive website analyzer to use Kimi K2 exclusively after discovering it's 10x cheaper ($0.003 vs $0.03+) while maintaining accuracy. Fixed UI display issues and prepared batch processing for 304 utility tokens from Supabase.

### Technical Implementation

#### Kimi K2 Validation
- Tested Kimi K2 with parsed website content (previously it tried direct browsing)
- Results proved accurate: correctly identified 8 team members for GAI, 10 for TRWA
- Scores aligned with other models when given parsed content
- Decision: Use Kimi K2 exclusively for cost efficiency

#### Database and UI Fixes
1. **Fixed N/A ticker display**:
   - Issue: API was trying to JOIN with non-existent `tokens` table
   - Solution: Modified `comprehensive_results_server.py` to read ticker directly from `website_analysis` table
   - Updated all existing records with correct tickers from Supabase

2. **Populated missing analysis details**:
   - Issue: Manual save function only stored basic data (score, no reasoning)
   - Solution: Re-analyzed tokens with full analysis pipeline
   - Updated database with reasoning, technical_depth, team_transparency fields

#### Batch Analyzer Setup
Created `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` that:
- Pulls utility tokens from Supabase (where `analysis_token_type = 'utility'`)
- Found 308 unique websites (304 still to analyze)
- Orders by liquidity (highest first)
- Saves ticker information with analyses
- Estimated cost: $0.91 for all 304 sites

### Key Discoveries

#### Analysis Prompt Bias
Current prompt in `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` is too heavily weighted on team transparency:
- Most tokens score 2-3/10 simply for lacking visible teams
- Binary scoring: 7/10 with team, 2-3/10 without
- Missing evaluation of technical infrastructure, documentation, tokenomics

#### Actual Token Counts
- Supabase has 308 unique utility token websites (not 128 as in local SQLite)
- Identified using `analysis_token_type` OR `x_analysis_token_type = 'utility'`
- 80 tokens where both AIs agree it's utility
- 220 where only call analysis says utility
- 112 where only X analysis says utility

### Files Modified
- `comprehensive_results_server.py` - Fixed ticker display, now reads from local table
- `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` - Defaults to Kimi K2 only
- `update_existing_records.py` - Script to populate missing tickers
- `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` - Production batch analyzer with liquidity ordering

### Production Ready
- ✅ UI displays tickers correctly
- ✅ Batch analyzer configured for Kimi K2 ($0.003/site)
- ✅ 304 utility token websites ready to analyze
- ✅ Estimated 1.5 hours to complete full batch
- ⚠️ Need to refine scoring prompt for better balance

### Next Steps
1. Run batch analysis on 304 utility tokens
2. Refine prompt to reduce team transparency bias
3. Consider weighted scoring across all factors
4. Add progress tracking to batch analyzer

## August 19, 2025 (Session 2) - Website Analysis Orchestrator Integration & Parallelization

### Session Overview
Successfully integrated website analysis into the crypto monitoring orchestrator pipeline, fixing critical issue where notification decisions were made before complete analysis. Parallelized website batch processing to handle up to 5 tokens simultaneously.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Fixed Website Analyzer Edge Function
- **Issue**: JSON parsing error - AI response was being double-parsed
- **Solution**: Added proper JSON handling with markdown code block stripping
- **Tier Update**: Verified TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA system working correctly
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to `crypto-website-analyzer`

#### 2. Website Analysis Testing Results
Successfully analyzed multiple tokens with consistent scoring:
- **VANTUM**: 9/21 (BASIC, utility) - Privacy-focused DeFi solution
- **PROTO**: 8/21 (BASIC, utility) - Decentralized infrastructure  
- **IRIS**: 7/21 & 6/21 (TRASH, utility) - Multiple versions
- **JAKPOT**: 4/21 (TRASH, utility)
- **Meme tokens**: Consistently scored 1-3/21 (TRASH tier)
  - NEKO, SCAN, THEND, SALLY, PCRYPTO, PEPE, BORIS, PICKLE

#### 3. Parallelized Batch Processing
**Before**: Sequential processing, 3 tokens, ~60 seconds
**After**: Parallel processing with optimizations:
- Processes 5 tokens simultaneously (matches KROM poller intake)
- 45-second timeout per website (increased from 30s)
- Total execution: ~45-47 seconds for all 5
- Uses `Promise.allSettled()` for robust error handling

#### 4. Orchestrator Integration
Added website analysis as Step 3 in orchestrator flow:
1. Poll for new calls → 2. Call/X Analysis (parallel) → **3. Website Analysis** → 4. Notifications

This ensures complete data before notification decisions, preventing premature 'notified' marking.

#### 5. Critical Issue Discovery & Resolution
**Problem**: When 5 new tokens arrive but only 3 get website analysis, notifier makes permanent decisions on incomplete data.
**Solution**: Parallelized all 5 tokens, ensuring complete analysis before notifications.

### Retry Logic Analysis

Discovered inconsistent retry patterns across analyzers:
- **Call Analysis**: Sets `score = 5` on failure (no retries)
- **X Analysis**: Leaves DB untouched (infinite retries)
- **Website Analysis**: Currently infinite retries (matches X pattern)

**Options for next session**:
1. Keep current behavior (infinite retries)
2. Add retry limit with counter
3. Mark as failed after timeout
4. Smart retry with exponential backoff

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-website-analyzer/index.ts` - Fixed JSON parsing
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-website-analyzer-batch/index.ts` - Parallelized
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-orchestrator-with-x/index.ts` - Added website step
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-notifier-complete/index.ts` - Added website data

### Performance Metrics
- Website analysis success rate: ~80%
- Processing time: ~45 seconds for 5 websites
- Orchestrator total time: ~55-60 seconds with website analysis

**Session End: August 19, 2025 (Session 2)**

## August 19, 2025 (Session 4) - ATH Tracking Infrastructure Fix

### Overview
Successfully resolved critical ATH tracking system failures by implementing a two-tier processing architecture based on token liquidity. The ultra tracker was consistently hitting Supabase Edge Function CPU limits, preventing ATH notifications from functioning.

### Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Ultra tracker processing 6,942 tokens (including dead tokens) hitting 2-second CPU limit
- **Symptoms**: No ATH notifications in days, function returning "WORKER_LIMIT" errors
- **Root Cause**: Supabase Edge Functions have strict 2-second CPU time limit regardless of paid plan

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Two-Tier System Architecture
**High-Priority Ultra Tracker**:
- Processes 1,888 tokens with ≥$20K liquidity
- Runs every minute via cron job `crypto-ultra-tracker-high-liquidity`
- Handles most active, liquid tokens likely to have ATH movements
- Performance: ~93 seconds processing time, well within limits

**Low-Priority Ultra Tracker**:  
- Processes 2,085 tokens with $1K-$20K liquidity
- Runs every 10 minutes via cron job `crypto-ultra-tracker-low-priority`
- Covers remaining active tokens with less frequent checks
- Performance: ~81 seconds processing time

#### 2. Key Optimizations
- **Removed dead token processing**: Cut total tokens from 6,942 to 3,994 (43% reduction)
- **Liquidity-based filtering**: High-impact tokens get priority monitoring
- **Separate revival checking**: Dead token revival moved to separate function (planned)

#### 3. Database Changes
Added liquidity threshold filtering:
```typescript
.gte('liquidity_usd', LIQUIDITY_THRESHOLD)  // $20K for main tracker
.lt('liquidity_usd', MAX_LIQUIDITY)         // <$20K for low priority
```

### Testing Results
- **1,000 tokens**: ✅ 43.2s processing time
- **2,000 tokens**: ✅ 119.1s processing time  
- **4,000+ tokens**: ❌ CPU limit errors
- **1,888 tokens (high-priority)**: ✅ 93.5s processing time
- **2,085 tokens (low-priority)**: ✅ 81.0s processing time

### Deployment Status
✅ **Both functions deployed and operational**:
- High-priority tracker: Every minute
- Low-priority tracker: Every 10 minutes
- All 3,973 active tokens now monitored within 10 minutes maximum
- Telegram notifications via @KROMATHAlerts_bot restored

### Edge Functions Updated
1. **crypto-ultra-tracker** - Modified for high-liquidity tokens only
2. **crypto-ultra-tracker-low** - New function for low-liquidity tokens
3. **Cron jobs updated** - New scheduling for both tiers

### Immediate Impact
- ATH tracking resumed: tokens showing "0.0 hours ago" updates
- No more CPU limit errors
- Complete coverage maintained with intelligent prioritization
- Foundation for future scalability as token count grows

## August 19, 2025 (Session 5) - Filter Persistence & UI Enhancements

### Overview
Enhanced the KROM analysis app with persistent filter states and improved reset functionality. Users now have consistent, personalized filtering experiences across sessions.

### Features Implemented

#### 1. Filter State Persistence
- **localStorage Integration**: All filter selections automatically saved
- **Cross-Session Consistency**: Filters restored when users return
- **Covered Filters**:
  - Token type (utility/meme/all)
  - Network selection (Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Base, etc.)
  - Exclude rugs toggle
  - Liquidity and market cap ranges
  - Social media filters (Website, Twitter, Telegram)
  - Analysis score thresholds (Call, X, Website)

#### 2. Filter Section Persistence
- **Section States Saved**: Open/collapsed state of each filter section
- **Personalized Layout**: Users' preferred UI organization maintained
- **Smart Defaults**: Token Type section open, others collapsed by default

#### 3. Enhanced Reset Functionality
- **Button Updated**: Changed "Clear" to "Reset" for better UX
- **Comprehensive Reset**: 
  - Clears all filter values to defaults
  - Collapses all sections except Token Type
  - Removes both localStorage keys
  - Provides fresh, organized starting state

### Technical Implementation

#### localStorage Keys
```typescript
'kromFilters' - Filter values and selections
'kromFilterSections' - Section collapsed/expanded states
```

#### Functions Added
```typescript
getInitialFilterState() - Loads saved filters with fallback defaults
getSectionStates() - Loads saved section states
resetAllFilters() - Comprehensive reset with section management
```

#### Auto-Save System  
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('kromFilters', JSON.stringify(filters))
}, [filters])

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('kromFilterSections', JSON.stringify(sectionStates))
}, [/* all section states */])
```

### User Experience Improvements
- **Seamless Continuity**: Filters persist exactly as users left them
- **Organized Reset**: One-click return to clean, structured state  
- **Intuitive Behavior**: Reset closes sections for visual clarity
- **No Data Loss**: Accidental page refreshes don't lose filter work

### Files Modified
- `/krom-analysis-app/app/page.tsx` - Main implementation
  - Added localStorage persistence logic
  - Updated state initialization  
  - Enhanced reset functionality
  - Added section state management

### Deployment
✅ **Live at**: https://lively-torrone-8199e0.netlify.app
- Successfully deployed at 14:33 UTC
- All features tested and operational
- Backward compatible with existing users

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: localStorage operations are lightweight
- **Client-Side Only**: No additional API calls
- **Efficient**: Only saves when states actually change
- **Robust**: Error handling for corrupted localStorage data

## August 20, 2025 - Website Analysis Integration & God Mode Admin Features

### Context
Integrated website analysis into the main orchestrator and implemented god mode admin features for marking imposter tokens.

### Session Summary

#### Part 1: Website Analysis Integration
Successfully integrated website analysis into the production crypto monitoring pipeline:

**Problem Identified**: 
- Website analysis wasn't running automatically
- crypto-orchestrator-with-x was using wrong notifier (only premium channel)
- Multiple orchestrator versions causing confusion

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Updated Main Orchestrator**: Added website analysis to original crypto-orchestrator
   - Now includes: Poller → Claude → X Analysis → Website Analysis → Notifier
   - Processes 5 websites/minute (300/hour)
   - ~12 hours to complete remaining 3,594 tokens

2. **Orchestrator Consolidation**:
   - Archived unused orchestrators to `/archive/edge-functions/`
   - Deleted from Supabase: crypto-orchestrator-fast, crypto-orchestrator-with-x
   - Also archived crypto-notifier-complete (wasn't sending notifications)
   - Single orchestrator now handles everything

**Verification**:
- 100 websites analyzed in 20 minutes
- Consistent rate of 5 websites/minute
- Cron job calling updated endpoint every minute

#### Part 2: God Mode Admin Features

**Problem**: Many high-scoring websites were imposter sites (e.g., SPL TOKEN using horny.wtf)

**Solution**: Implemented admin features with secret URL parameter

1. **Database Changes**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN is_imposter BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN imposter_marked_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
   ```

2. **Access Method**: `?god=mode` URL parameter
   - No authentication needed (security through obscurity)
   - Chose this over Telegram auth for simplicity

3. **Features Added**:
   - "Mark Imposter" button on each token (god mode only)
   - Visual indicators: Red strikethrough on imposter ticker names
   - Toggle functionality: Mark/unmark with single click
   - API endpoint: `/api/mark-imposter`
   - Filter support: `excludeImposters` parameter ready for future use

4. **UI Changes**:
   - Normal tokens: White ticker name
   - Imposter tokens: Red strikethrough ticker
   - Admin button: Gray "Mark Imposter" or Red "🚫 Imposter"

### Deployment Status
✅ All features deployed to production
- Live at: https://lively-torrone-8199e0.netlify.app
- God mode: https://lively-torrone-8199e0.netlify.app?god=mode

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-orchestrator/index.ts` - Added website analysis step
- `/krom-analysis-app/app/page.tsx` - Added god mode detection
- `/krom-analysis-app/components/RecentCalls.tsx` - Added admin UI
- `/krom-analysis-app/app/api/mark-imposter/route.ts` - New API endpoint
- `/krom-analysis-app/app/api/recent-calls/route.ts` - Added imposter filtering

### Files Archived
- `crypto-orchestrator-with-x` → `/archive/edge-functions/crypto-orchestrator-with-x-2025-08-20.ts`
- `crypto-orchestrator-fast` → `/archive/edge-functions/crypto-orchestrator-fast-2025-08-20.ts`
- `crypto-notifier-complete` → `/archive/edge-functions/crypto-notifier-complete-2025-08-20.ts`

### Key Decisions
1. Simplified to single orchestrator instead of maintaining multiple versions
2. Used URL parameter for admin access instead of complex auth system
3. Archived unused functions for reference rather than deleting completely
