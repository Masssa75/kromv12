# Session Log - August 2025

## August 12, 2025 - ATH Verifier Development & Debugging

### Session Overview
Worked on fixing the crypto-ath-verifier Edge Function that was failing to run due to network support issues. Successfully debugged and deployed the verifier, but discovered it was incorrectly "correcting" valid ATH values.

### Major Issues Fixed

#### 1. ATH Verifier Not Running
**Problem**: The verifier had never successfully run since deployment
- JWT issue - was using anon key instead of service role key
- Unsupported networks causing function to hang
- No error handling for API failures

**Solution**:
- Fixed JWT by creating new cron job with service role key
- Added network validation to skip unsupported networks
- Added timeout protection and error handling
- Successfully deployed and tested

#### 2. Wick Filtering Logic Confusion
**Initial Problem**: Verifier was calculating incorrect ATH values (e.g., DAWAE showing $0.01146 instead of ~$0.0035)

**Investigation revealed**:
- DAWAE had a 6.4x wick on June 6, 2025 (flash spike to $0.01146)
- Original logic used `Math.max(open, close)` to filter wicks
- Multiple iterations of fixing the logic

**Key Discovery**: The original `crypto-ath-historical` function and the verifier serve different purposes:
- **crypto-ath-historical**: Initial ATH calculation using "realistic selling points" philosophy
- **crypto-ath-update**: Updates ATH when new highs detected
- **crypto-ath-verifier**: Should verify/correct historical ATH from all data

#### 3. Verifier Breaking Correct Values (RESOLVED)
**Critical Issue**: Verifier was "correcting" already-correct ATH values
- T1 (Trump Mobile): Changed correct $0.00016 to incorrect $0.00004
- ORC CITY: Changed correct $0.00032 to incorrect $0.00020
- BEANIE: Incorrectly flagged as inflated

**Root Cause Found**: Key difference between historical and verifier functions:
- **Historical (CORRECT)**: Uses `Math.max(open, close)` to filter wicks
- **Verifier (BROKEN)**: Was using `high` directly without filtering
- **Additional issues**: Verifier wasn't starting from call day midnight, had different time windows

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed verifier to use `Math.max(open, close)` like historical function
- Aligned time period selection (start from call day midnight)
- Matched time windows for candle filtering (1 hour for minute data)
- Tested on T1 and ORC CITY - both maintained correct values

### Technical Implementations

#### Enhanced Notifications
Added to ATH verification alerts:
- DexScreener links for easy verification (later changed to GeckoTerminal)
- Call date/time for context
- Improved formatting for mobile viewing

#### Network Support
Added support for additional networks in NETWORK_MAP:
- hyperevm
- linea
- abstract
- tron
- sui
- ton

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ath-verifier/index.ts` - Multiple iterations of logic fixes
- `/pause_verifier.sql` - Created to pause cron job (later deleted)
- `/supabase/migrations/20250812_pause_verifier.sql` - Migration to pause verifier (later deleted)

### Cron Job Status
- Created `crypto-ath-verifier-every-10-min` with service role key
- Successfully paused when issues discovered
- Ready to restart once logic is corrected

### Testing Results
Ran verifier on 30 tokens and found 40% had discrepancies:
- Some legitimate (VITALIK.ETH was 96% inflated due to wick)
- Many false positives (breaking correct ATH values)

### Next Session Notes
**CRITICAL**: The original `crypto-ath-historical` function calculates CORRECT ATH values. Need to:
1. Compare the exact logic between historical and verifier functions
2. Understand why historical gets correct values with `Math.max(open, close)`
3. Fix verifier to match historical's accuracy
4. The issue is likely in candle selection, not in the open/close vs high logic

**Key Insight**: The verifier might be looking at the wrong time period or selecting candles differently than the historical function.

### Session End Status
- Verifier is paused (cron job unscheduled)
- Original historical function confirmed working correctly
- Need to investigate exact difference in logic between functions

## August 12, 2025 (Continued) - ATH Verifier Fix & Deployment

### Problem Resolution
Successfully identified and fixed the ATH verifier logic issue causing incorrect ATH values.

### Root Cause Analysis
Compared `crypto-ath-historical` (working) with `crypto-ath-verifier` (broken):
- **Historical**: Used `Math.max(open, close)` to filter wicks - CORRECT
- **Verifier**: Used `high` directly without filtering - INCORRECT
- **Additional differences**: Time period selection and window sizes

### Solution Implementation
Fixed verifier to match historical function's logic:
1. Use `Math.max(open, close)` instead of `high` for realistic ATH
2. Start from call day midnight (not exact timestamp)
3. Match time windows (1 hour for minute data, not 2 hours)
4. Tested successfully on T1 and ORC CITY tokens

### Bulk Correction Results
Re-verified 100 recently tested tokens:
- **18% correction rate** (18 out of 100 tokens corrected)
- **15 MISSED_ATH** - Values were too low, corrected up
- **3 INFLATED_ATH** - Values were too high, corrected down
- **Notable**: ANI token restored to 23,183% ROI

### Final Configuration
- **Schedule**: Every minute (optimized from 10 minutes)
- **Batch Size**: 20 tokens per run
- **Processing Rate**: ~1,170 tokens/hour
- **Full Cycle**: ~3.2 hours for 3,761 active tokens
- **API Usage**: 12% of quota (3,600/30,000 calls/hour)
- **Notifications**: Changed to GeckoTerminal links
- **Thresholds**: 10% for correction, 25% for alerts

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ath-verifier/index.ts` - Fixed logic
- `/test-t1-verifier.py` - Test script created
- `/test-orc-city-verifier.py` - Test script created

### Session End Status
- ✅ Verifier FIXED and running continuously
- ✅ 95% accuracy confirmed by user
- ✅ Correction rate decreasing as tokens get verified

# Session Log - August 2025

## August 7, 2025 - Evening (5:00 PM) - Complete Market Cap Implementation

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive market cap tracking system across the entire KROMV12 database. Added supply data fetching, market cap calculations, and dead token revival functionality.

### Phase 1: Updated crypto-poller for New Calls
**Files Modified:**
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-poller/index.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Renamed `fetchCurrentPrice` to `fetchCurrentPriceAndSupply`
2. Added extraction of `fdv_usd` and `market_cap_usd` from GeckoTerminal API
3. Implemented supply calculations:
   - `total_supply = fdv / price`
   - `circulating_supply = market_cap / price` (or total if market_cap null)
4. Added market_cap_at_call calculation when supplies are similar (within 5%)
5. Deployed and verified with test tokens (FUH, MONO, PROTECT)

**Results:**
- All new calls now automatically get supply data and market caps
- Successfully tested with re-added tokens showing correct calculations

### Phase 2: Backfilled Existing Tokens
**Script Created:**
- `/populate-all-marketcaps.py` - Comprehensive backfill script

**Implementation:**
1. Fetches supply data from DexScreener API (30 tokens per batch)
2. Calculates market caps based on supply similarity:
   - `market_cap_at_call` (only if circulating ≈ total supply)
   - `current_market_cap` (always calculated)
   - `ath_market_cap` (only if supplies similar)
3. Implemented pagination to process ALL tokens (not just first 1000)

**Backfill Results:**
- **3,153 tokens** populated with supply data (98.7% coverage!)
- **2,951 tokens** have market_cap_at_call
- **3,230 tokens** have current_market_cap
- Only 42 tokens remain without data (likely permanently dead/delisted)
- Notable additions: SOL ($92B market cap), FARTCOIN ($1.35B), POPCAT ($473M)

### Phase 3: Updated crypto-ultra-tracker
**Files Modified:**
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ultra-tracker/index.ts`

**Changes:**
1. Added `circulating_supply, total_supply` to SELECT query (line 209)
2. Added current_market_cap calculation on price updates:
   ```typescript
   if (token.circulating_supply && currentPrice > 0) {
     updateData.current_market_cap = currentPrice * token.circulating_supply
   }
   ```
3. Added ath_market_cap calculation on ATH updates:
   ```typescript
   if (token.total_supply && newATH > 0) {
     updateData.ath_market_cap = newATH * token.total_supply
   }
   ```
4. Deployed and verified with test batch

**Verification:**
- Tested with 167 tokens, all updated successfully
- Market caps calculating correctly (100% accuracy in verification)

### Phase 4: Dead Token Revival System
**Scripts Created:**
1. `/process-dead-tokens.py` - Sequential version (2 sec/token)
2. `/process-dead-tokens-parallel.py` - Parallel version (150 req/min)

**Implementation:**
- Uses GeckoTerminal API to check if dead tokens are trading again
- If trading: revives token with complete supply and market cap data
- Parallel processing with 20 workers and rate limiting

**Revival Results (First 1000 tokens):**
- Processed 1,000 tokens in **6.1 minutes**
- **206 tokens revived** (20.6% revival rate)
- Processing rate: 165 tokens/minute
- Notable revivals: MONKEPHONE ($99K liquidity), RICH ($53K liquidity)
- Many tokens have liquidity but zero volume (zombie pools)

### Database Backup
Created backup script and saved snapshot before changes:
- File: `database_backup_20250807_140246.json`
- Contains all market cap related fields for rollback if needed

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Supply Similarity Threshold**: Used 5% difference consistently across all components to determine if circulating ≈ total supply

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If no FDV: leave supplies as null
   - If no market_cap: assume circulating = total (common for pump.fun tokens)
   - Still insert calls even without supply data (can be fetched later)

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Parallel processing for dead tokens (20x faster)
   - Batch processing for backfill (30 tokens per API call)
   - Rate limiting to respect API limits (150 req/min for paid tier)

### Files Created/Modified

**New Scripts:**
- `/populate-all-marketcaps.py` - Backfill script for existing tokens
- `/fix-all-current-marketcaps.py` - Fix stale market caps
- `/process-dead-tokens.py` - Sequential dead token processor
- `/process-dead-tokens-parallel.py` - Parallel dead token processor
- `/backup-database.py` - Database backup utility
- `/test-ultra-tracker.py` - Test script for ultra-tracker
- `/verify-market-caps.py` - Verification script
- `/investigate-remaining-tokens.py` - Debug script for failed tokens
- `/test-supply-data.py` - Test supply data from crypto-poller
- `/check-recent-tokens.py` - Check recent token data
- `/test-gecko-supply.py` - Test GeckoTerminal API
- `/test-gecko-supply2.py` - Test with real pool
- `/verify-backfill.py` - Verify backfill results

**Modified Edge Functions:**
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-poller/index.ts`
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ultra-tracker/index.ts`

### Next Session Notes
**Remaining Work:**
- Process remaining ~2,000 dead tokens (already have parallel script ready)
- Consider adding supply fetching to ultra-tracker for tokens that revive naturally
- Monitor for any edge cases in production

**Important Context:**
- 98.7% of tokens now have complete market cap data
- System automatically maintains market caps going forward
- Dead token revival can be run periodically as one-off script

## Session: KROM Public Interface - Pagination & Sorting - August 7, 2025 (Afternoon)

### Overview
Continued development of the KROM public landing page, adding pagination and sorting functionality to the Recent Calls section. Fixed styling issues and ensured data consistency between TOP EARLY CALLS and Recent Calls sections.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. Pagination System Implementation
- **Increased items per page**: 20 (from 10) for better data density
- **Clean navigation controls**: 
  - First/last page buttons (««, »»)
  - Previous/next arrows (‹, ›)
  - Smart page number display (5 pages visible)
- **Simplified UI**: Removed text labels ("Previous", "Next") for cleaner design
- **Page reset logic**: Automatically returns to page 1 when sorting changes

#### 2. Sorting Functionality
- **Sort dropdown component**: `/components/sort-dropdown.tsx`
- **Available sort options**:
  - Date Called (default)
  - Call Score / X Score
  - ROI % / ATH ROI %
  - 24h Volume / Liquidity
  - 24h Price Change
  - Market Cap (Current/At Call)
  - Token Name
- **Ascending/descending toggle** with arrow button
- **Dark theme styling**: Matches mockup design perfectly

#### 3. Data Consistency Fixes
- **ATH ROI sorting logic**:
  - Filters out null values completely
  - Only shows tokens with ATH ROI > 0
  - Matches TOP EARLY CALLS filtering
- **API optimization**:
  - Special handling for ROI sorts
  - Proper count queries for pagination
  - Efficient database queries

#### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Dark theme dropdown**:
  - Background: `#1a1c1f`
  - Borders: `#2a2d31`
  - Hover states: `#222426`
  - Text colors: `#666` (labels), `#ccc` (content)
- **ATH ROI column**: Added to show both current and ATH ROI
- **Fixed TypeScript errors** in GeckoTerminalPanel

### Technical Details

#### API Modifications (`/app/api/recent-calls/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Smart filtering for ATH ROI
if (isAthRoiSort) {
  query = query
    .not('ath_roi_percent', 'is', null)
    .gt('ath_roi_percent', 0)
    .order('ath_roi_percent', { ascending: sortOrder === 'asc' })
}
```

#### Component Updates
- **RecentCalls.tsx**: Added pagination controls, ATH ROI column, sort integration
- **sort-dropdown.tsx**: Created with dark theme styling
- **geckoterminal-panel.tsx**: Removed undefined properties causing build errors

### Issues Resolved
1. **White dropdown background**: Applied dark theme colors
2. **Data mismatch**: TOP EARLY CALLS filters by time period, Recent Calls shows all time
3. **Missing price data**: Database issue - many tokens lack price_at_call and ath_price
4. **Build failures**: Fixed TypeScript errors with undefined properties

### Next Session Planning
**Filters Implementation** - Ready to add:
1. ROI Range slider (min/max filtering)
2. Networks checkboxes (ETH, SOL, BSC, Base)
3. Time Period filter (24H, 7D, 30D, All Time)
4. AI Score filter (Alpha, Solid, Basic, Trash)

### Files Modified
- `/components/RecentCalls.tsx` - Added pagination, sorting, ATH ROI column
- `/components/sort-dropdown.tsx` - Created with dark theme
- `/app/api/recent-calls/route.ts` - Added sort/filter logic
- `/components/geckoterminal-panel.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript errors

### Deployment
- All changes deployed successfully to https://lively-torrone-8199e0.netlify.app
- Build issues resolved
- Performance optimized

## Session: KROM Public Interface - Basic Structure - August 7, 2025 (Morning)

[Previous session content continues below...]

## Session: ATH Tracking System Implementation - August 4-5, 2025

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive All-Time High (ATH) tracking and notification system for the KROM crypto monitoring platform. The system continuously monitors ~5,700 tokens, detects new ATHs, and sends instant Telegram notifications for significant gains.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. ATH Calculation System
- Created 3-tier historical ATH calculation using GeckoTerminal OHLCV data:
  - Daily candles → Hourly candles → Minute candles for precision
- Implemented realistic ATH pricing using `max(open, close)` instead of wick highs
- Added protection against negative ROI (minimum 0%)
- Successfully tested with 100% accuracy on sample tokens

#### 2. Database Architecture
- Added `ath_last_checked` column for efficient queue management
- Optimized from 3 API calls to 1 call for existing ATH updates
- Processing capacity: ~25 tokens/minute with free API tier

#### 3. Edge Functions Created
- **`crypto-ath-historical`**: Full 3-tier ATH calculation for new tokens
- **`crypto-ath-update`**: Optimized continuous monitoring (1 API call)
- **`crypto-ath-notifier`**: Telegram notification sender

#### 4. Notification System
- Direct notification architecture (no polling delay)
- Instant alerts when tokens hit new ATH with >10% gain
- Beautiful formatted messages with performance metrics
- Created dedicated Telegram bot: @KROMATHAlerts_bot

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Database Schema Addition
```sql
ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN ath_last_checked TIMESTAMPTZ;
```

#### Optimized ATH Checking Logic
For tokens with existing ATH data:
- Fetch only hourly candles since last check (1 API call)
- If new high found, fetch minute precision (1 additional call)
- Average: 1.2 API calls per token vs 3 calls originally

#### Direct Notification Pattern
Instead of polling with cron:
```typescript
// In crypto-ath-update when new ATH detected
if (athRoi > 10) {
  fetch('crypto-ath-notifier', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ tokenData })
  }).catch(err => console.error('Notification failed:', err))
}
```

#### Cron Job Configuration
```sql
-- Continuous ATH monitoring
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'ath-continuous-update',
  '* * * * *',  -- Every minute
  -- Calls crypto-ath-update with 25 tokens
);
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: 25 tokens/minute (free tier limit)
- **Full Database Scan**: ~3.8 hours
- **API Efficiency**: ~70% reduction in API calls
- **Notification Latency**: < 1 second from detection

### Challenges & Solutions

#### 1. Initial Design Revision
**Problem**: Original design used polling (5-minute delay for notifications)
**Solution**: Switched to direct notification calls from ATH update function

#### 2. DexScreener Links
**Problem**: Broken links with "Unknown" contract addresses
**Solution**: Made contract address optional, only show link when valid

#### 3. Rate Limiting
**Problem**: GeckoTerminal free tier limited to 30 calls/minute
**Solution**: Optimized to use 1 call for most updates, process 25 tokens/minute

### Current Status
- ✅ System fully operational
- ✅ Processing 278 tokens in first 45 minutes
- ✅ 2 new ATHs detected (DB +36.8%, WLFI reached new high)
- ✅ Notifications working in test group
- 📊 Continuous monitoring of entire database every ~4 hours

### Example Notification
```
🎯 NEW ALL-TIME HIGH ALERT!

TOKEN just hit a new ATH 🔥 +250%

📊 Performance:
• Entry: $0.001
• ATH: $0.0035
• Gain: 🔥 +250%

⏱️ Timing:
• Called: 2 days ago
• ATH reached: 5 minutes ago

📍 Details:
• Group: Crypto Signals
• Network: ethereum
• Contract: 0x...

[View on DexScreener](link)

🔔 Set alerts to catch the next pump!
```

### Environment Variables Added
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_ATH`: Bot token for @KROMATHAlerts_bot
- `TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID_ATH`: Test group ID (-4635794373)

### Next Steps for Future Sessions
1. Consider implementing the real-time price monitor with DexScreener batch API
2. Add rate limiting to prevent notification spam during volatile periods
3. Create user preference system for notification thresholds
4. Implement historical ATH analysis dashboard
5. Consider push notification queue for scalability

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ath-historical/index.ts` - Initial implementation
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ath-update/index.ts` - New optimized function
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ath-notifier/index.ts` - New notification function
- `/.env` - Added Telegram bot credentials
- Database: Added `ath_last_checked` column

### Key Decisions
1. **Realistic ATH**: Use max(open, close) not wick high for realistic selling points
2. **Direct Notifications**: No polling, instant alerts for better user experience
3. **10% Threshold**: Only notify for significant gains to reduce noise
4. **Continuous Processing**: Every token checked every ~4 hours
5. **Fire-and-forget**: Notifications don't block ATH processing

---
**Session Duration**: ~8 hours
**Lines of Code**: ~500 new lines
**Database Records Affected**: 5,700+ tokens monitored

## Session: Row Level Security Implementation - August 5, 2025

### Overview
Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) on the crypto_calls table to protect the database from unauthorized modifications while maintaining public read access for the web application.

### Security Analysis Performed
1. **Identified Vulnerabilities**:
   - Database completely open for read/write/delete via anon key
   - Edge functions accessible without authentication
   - Public API endpoints could be abused for expensive operations
   - CSV download exposed entire analyzed dataset

2. **Attack Vectors Documented**:
   - Data deletion/corruption attacks
   - API quota exhaustion (GeckoTerminal, AI services)
   - Competitor intelligence gathering
   - Cost attacks via expensive AI analysis triggers

### Implementation

#### RLS Configuration
```sql
ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON crypto_calls 
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Service role write access
CREATE POLICY "Service role write access" ON crypto_calls 
  FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt()::jsonb->>'role' = 'service_role');
```

#### Impact Assessment
**What continues working:**
- ✅ Next.js API routes (use service_role key)
- ✅ All Supabase Edge Functions (use service_role key)
- ✅ Public read access for web app
- ✅ Client-side price fetching

**What needs updating:**
- ❌ Python scripts using anon key for writes
- ❌ Any future scripts must use service_role for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

### Documentation Updates
Updated CLAUDE.md with:
1. RLS enabled notice in critical database section
2. Detailed RLS rules under "Working with This Project"
3. Key usage guide under Environment Variables
4. Version bump to 8.1.0

### Key Decisions
1. Chose simple read-only policy to maintain app functionality
2. Prioritized preventing data deletion over complex access controls
3. Deferred authentication on edge functions for later implementation
4. Kept public read access to avoid breaking changes

### Security Improvements Achieved
- ✅ Database protected from deletion/corruption
- ✅ Write operations restricted to authorized services
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Clear documentation for future development

---
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours
**Critical Issue Resolved**: Database vulnerability to deletion attacks
**Implementation Time**: 5 minutes (after analysis)

## Session: System Maintenance & Cron Migration - August 5, 2025 (Later)

### Overview
Fixed critical API issues and migrated cron jobs from external service to Supabase native cron for better reliability and reduced external dependencies.

### Issues Resolved

#### 1. OpenRouter API Key Issue
**Problem**: Call and X analysis failing due to expired/invalid OpenRouter API key
- Error: "Invalid API key or insufficient credits"
- Last successful analysis: July 31, 2025
- Backlog: ~100 unanalyzed calls

**Solution**: Updated OpenRouter API key in Supabase secrets
```bash
supabase secrets set OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-xxxxx"
```

#### 2. Missing buy_timestamp Data
**Problem**: 12 records had NULL buy_timestamp preventing price calculations
**Root Cause**: crypto-poller was incorrectly setting price_updated_at instead of buy_timestamp

**Solution**: 
1. Fixed crypto-poller to set buy_timestamp correctly
2. Backfilled missing timestamps with manual SQL update
3. Verified all records now have proper buy_timestamp values

#### 3. Cron Job Migration
**Problem**: Using external cron-job.org service created dependency and potential reliability issues
**Solution**: Migrated all cron jobs to Supabase native pg_cron extension

**New Supabase Cron Jobs Created:**
```sql
-- Main orchestrator (every 30 minutes)
SELECT cron.schedule('crypto-orchestrator', '*/30 * * * *', 
  'SELECT net.http_post(url:=''[FUNCTION_URL]/crypto-orchestrator'')');

-- ATH monitoring (every minute, 25 tokens)
SELECT cron.schedule('crypto-ath-update', '* * * * *', 
  'SELECT net.http_post(url:=''[FUNCTION_URL]/crypto-ath-update'')');

-- Call analysis (every hour, 50 calls)
SELECT cron.schedule('krom-call-analysis', '0 * * * *', 
  'SELECT net.http_post(url:=''[FUNCTION_URL]crypto-analyzer'')');

-- X analysis (every 2 hours, 20 calls)
SELECT cron.schedule('krom-x-analysis', '0 */2 * * *', 
  'SELECT net.http_post(url:=''[FUNCTION_URL]/crypto-x-analyzer-nitter'')');
```

### Technical Implementation

#### crypto-poller Fix
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
price_updated_at: new Date().toISOString()

// After (correct)  
buy_timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
```

#### Data Backfill Query
```sql
UPDATE crypto_calls 
SET buy_timestamp = created_at 
WHERE buy_timestamp IS NULL 
  AND created_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### Current System Status
- ✅ All 4 cron jobs active in Supabase
- ✅ Analysis functions catching up to current date
- ✅ ATH monitoring processing continuously
- ✅ All API keys working correctly
- ✅ No external cron dependencies
- ✅ buy_timestamp data integrity restored

### Performance Monitoring
**Analysis Backlog Processing:**
- Call analysis: ~100 pending calls (processing at 50/hour)
- X analysis: ~200 pending calls (processing at 20 every 2 hours)
- Expected catch-up time: ~20 hours for full current status

**ATH Monitoring:**
- Processing 25 tokens/minute continuously
- Full database scan every ~4 hours
- 2,847 tokens checked in last cycle

### Key Decisions
1. **Native Cron**: Eliminated external dependency for better reliability
2. **Aggressive Scheduling**: More frequent analysis to maintain current data
3. **Immediate Fix**: Prioritized getting analysis working over optimization
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensured all records have proper timestamps

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-poller/index.ts` - Fixed buy_timestamp assignment
- Database: Updated 12 records with missing buy_timestamp
- Supabase cron: Created 4 new scheduled jobs
- External: Deactivated cron-job.org schedules

---
**Session Duration**: ~3 hours
**Key Achievement**: Eliminated external cron dependency, restored analysis pipeline

## Session 4: Supabase Cron Migration & Analysis Pipeline Fix (August 5, 2025 - Evening)

### Issues Addressed
1. **OpenRouter API Key Issue** - Analysis wasn't working due to missing API key in Netlify
2. **Newest Calls Not Showing in UI** - 313 unanalyzed calls preventing new entries from appearing
3. **External Cron Dependency** - Need to migrate from cron-job.org to Supabase native cron
4. **Database Field Inconsistency** - buy_timestamp not being set properly

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Fixed OpenRouter API Key
- Added `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY` to Netlify environment variables
- Deployed to production, verified analysis working
- Successfully analyzed 5 calls in test run

#### 2. Migrated to Supabase Native Cron Jobs
Created 4 pg_cron scheduled jobs:
- `crypto-orchestrator-every-minute` - Main monitoring pipeline
- `crypto-ath-update-every-minute` - ATH tracking
- `krom-call-analysis-every-minute` - Kimi K2 call analysis (1-10 scores)
- `krom-x-analysis-every-minute` - Kimi K2 X analysis (1-10 scores)

Key implementation details:
- Used URL-encoded CRON_SECRET for authentication
- All jobs running successfully with ~5-20ms execution time
- Netlify functions called via HTTP from Supabase

#### 3. Fixed buy_timestamp Logic
Modified `crypto-poller` edge function:
- Now sets `buy_timestamp` when recording `price_at_call`
- Falls back to current time if KROM doesn't provide timestamp
- No longer incorrectly uses `price_updated_at` field

#### 4. Database Cleanup
- Updated 12 records with missing buy_timestamp values
- Used `created_at` as fallback since raw_data didn't contain timestamps

### Technical Details

#### Supabase Cron Job Creation
```sql
select cron.schedule(
  'krom-call-analysis-every-minute',
  '* * * * *',
  $$select net.http_get(
    url:='https://lively-torrone-8199e0.netlify.app/api/cron/analyze?auth=...',
    headers:=jsonb_build_object('Content-Type', 'application/json')
  ) as request_id;$$
);
```

#### Progress Tracking
- Started: 313 unanalyzed calls
- Processing rate: 5 calls/minute (call), 3 calls/minute (X)
- By end of session: Down to ~200 unanalyzed
- System catching up chronologically (reached August 1st from June/July)

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-poller/index.ts` - Fixed buy_timestamp assignment
- Database: Updated 12 records with missing buy_timestamp
- Created: `SUPABASE_CRON_SETUP.md` - Documentation for cron job management
- Netlify: Added OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY environment variable

## August 11, 2025 - Critical Infrastructure Updates

### Session Overview
Major session fixing critical issues with ATH verification, implementing liquidity thresholds, and resolving ultra-tracker authentication problems. Multiple production issues identified and resolved.

### Part 1: ATH Verification System Overhaul

#### Issue Identified
The `crypto-ath-verifier` function was not actually verifying ATH values - it was only checking for NEW highs, not validating existing ATH data. This allowed incorrect ATH values to persist (like RAVE showing $0.3574 instead of $0.00315).

#### Solution Implemented
**Completely rewrote the verifier to be a TRUE verification system:**

1. **Always Recalculates from Scratch**
   - Ignores stored ATH values
   - Fetches daily, hourly, and minute OHLCV data
   - Finds actual historical peak since token call

2. **Detects All Discrepancy Types**
   - MISSED_ATH: When actual > stored
   - INFLATED_ATH: When stored > actual (like RAVE)
   - NO_ATH: When no ATH data exists

3. **Automatic Correction**
   - Fixes any discrepancy >10%
   - Sends Telegram alerts for >25% differences
   - Added `ath_verified_at` column for tracking

4. **Optimized Schedule**
   - Changed from every minute to every 10 minutes
   - Processes 10 tokens per run with 6-second delays
   - Full database verification in ~10.8 hours

**Files Modified:**
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ath-verifier/index.ts` - Complete rewrite
- Database: Added `ath_verified_at` column

### Part 2: Token ATH Corrections

#### RAVE Token Fix
- **Issue**: Stored ATH of $0.3574 was 100x too high
- **Actual ATH**: $0.00315125 (verified via GeckoTerminal OHLCV)
- **ROI Corrected**: From 120,436% to 962.89%

#### RYS Token Fix  
- **Issue**: Stored ATH of $0.0359 was 10x too high
- **Actual ATH**: $0.00213 (verified via GeckoTerminal OHLCV)
- **ROI Corrected**: From 26,879% to 1,500% for earliest call

### Part 3: $1000 Liquidity Threshold Implementation

#### Problem Identified
Tokens with <$1 liquidity (like SPEED with $0.89) were showing impossible metrics:
- Volume: $12.8M (physically impossible with $0.89 liquidity)
- ATH ROI: 1,414% (meaningless without liquidity)

#### Comprehensive Solution

**1. Database Analysis:**
- Found 16 tokens with liquidity < $1000
- Marked all as `is_dead = true`
- Examples: SPEED ($0.89), BOSS ($0.10), MARU ($0.89)

**2. Updated crypto-poller (Entry Point):**
```typescript
// Fetch liquidity from GeckoTerminal
const liquidity = parseFloat(attributes?.reserve_in_usd || '0');

// Mark dead on arrival if < $1000
if (liquidity < 1000) {
  callData.is_dead = true;
  console.log(`🪦 Token ${symbol} marked as DEAD - liquidity $${liquidity} < $1000`);
}
```

**3. Updated crypto-ultra-tracker:**
- Checks liquidity on every update
- Marks tokens dead if liquidity drops < $1000
- Can revive if liquidity recovers > $1000
- Tracks `liquidityDeaths` and `revivals`

**4. Updated token-revival-checker:**
- Only revives tokens if liquidity >= $1000
- Updates liquidity values even for dead tokens
- Sends notifications for successful revivals

**5. Updated crypto-notifier-complete:**
- Added `.or('is_dead.eq.false,is_dead.is.null')` to all queries
- Prevents notifications for dead tokens
- Users never see untradeable opportunities

**Files Modified:**
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-poller/index.ts`
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-ultra-tracker/index.ts`
- `/supabase/functions/token-revival-checker/index.ts`
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-notifier-complete/index.ts`

### Part 4: Ultra-Tracker Authentication Fix

#### Critical Issue
Ultra-tracker stopped working completely - all new tokens showing "N/A" for price data.

#### Root Cause
The cron job was calling ultra-tracker with an invalid JWT token. The service role key in the cron configuration was corrupted.

#### Solution
1. **Diagnosed Issue:**
   - Error: "Invalid JWT" on all calls
   - Even service role key was failing

2. **Fixed Cron Job:**
   ```bash
   # Unscheduled broken job
   SELECT cron.unschedule('crypto-ultra-tracker-every-minute');
   
   # Recreated with correct service role key from .env
   SELECT cron.schedule(
     'crypto-ultra-tracker-every-minute', 
     '* * * * *',
     $$ SELECT net.http_post(...) $$
   );
   ```

3. **Verification:**
   - Tokens now updating with prices, ATH, ROI
   - Processing 3200 tokens per minute
   - All market data tracking restored

### Database Changes Summary

**New Columns Added:**
- `ath_verified_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Tracks when ATH was last verified

**Tokens Updated:**
- 16 tokens marked as dead (liquidity < $1000)
- RAVE ATH corrected: $0.3574 → $0.00315
- RYS ATH corrected: $0.0359 → $0.00213

**Cron Jobs Modified:**
- `crypto-ath-verifier-every-minute` → Now runs every 10 minutes
- `crypto-ultra-tracker-every-minute` → Fixed with correct service role key

### Edge Functions Deployed
1. `crypto-ath-verifier` (v5) - Complete verification rewrite
2. `crypto-ultra-tracker` (v24) - Added liquidity threshold
3. `crypto-poller` (v27) - Added liquidity detection
4. `crypto-notifier-complete` (v14) - Skip dead tokens
5. `token-revival-checker` (v2) - Liquidity threshold for revival

### Key Metrics
- **Dead tokens**: 4,084 (was 4,068)
- **Alive tokens**: 2,387 (was 2,403)
- **Tokens below $1000 liquidity**: 0 alive (all marked dead)
- **Processing capacity**: 3,200 tokens/minute (ultra-tracker)
- **Verification rate**: 10 tokens/10 minutes (ath-verifier)

### Testing & Verification
- ✅ RAVE ATH corrected and verified
- ✅ RYS ATH corrected and verified
- ✅ Low liquidity tokens marked as dead
- ✅ Notifier skipping dead tokens
- ✅ Ultra-tracker processing all tokens
- ✅ New tokens getting liquidity checks

### Production Impact
- **Improved data quality**: No more inflated ATH values
- **User protection**: No notifications for untradeable tokens
- **System efficiency**: Dead tokens excluded from notifications
- **Automatic recovery**: Tokens can revive if liquidity improves
