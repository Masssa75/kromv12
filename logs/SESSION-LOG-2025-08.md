# KROM Session Logs - August 2025

## August 19, 2025 - Website Analysis Integration & UI Enhancements

### Overview
Successfully integrated the website analysis system into the KROM crypto monitoring pipeline. Updated the scoring system to use standard TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA tiers, enhanced UI settings for granular control, and prepared for orchestrator integration.

### Key Achievements

#### 1. Database Migration
- **Constraint Update**: Dropped old HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW constraint and added TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA
- **Data Migration**: Successfully updated 8 existing tokens from old tier names to new
- **SQL Executed**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE crypto_calls SET website_tier = CASE 
    WHEN website_tier = 'LOW' THEN 'TRASH'
    WHEN website_tier = 'MEDIUM' THEN 'BASIC'
    WHEN website_tier = 'HIGH' THEN 'SOLID'
  END WHERE website_tier IN ('LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH');
  ```

#### 2. Edge Function Updates
- **Function**: `crypto-website-analyzer` 
- **Changes**: Updated AI prompt to output TRASH/BASIC/SOLID/ALPHA tiers
- **Tier Mapping**:
  - 0-7 points → TRASH
  - 8-14 points → BASIC
  - 15-20 points → SOLID
  - 21 points → ALPHA
- **Token Classification**: Removed "hybrid" option, now only "meme" or "utility"

#### 3. UI Enhancements
- **Settings Modal Improvements**:
  - Added separate toggles for scores vs tier badges
  - Two sections: "Analysis Types" and "Display Options"
  - Users can show scores only, badges only, both, or neither
  - Settings persist in localStorage
  
- **Display Standardization**:
  - Website scores now display as 0-10 (converted from 0-21 internally)
  - All tier badges use consistent colors
  - Fixed duplicate token type badges
  - Social filters default to unchecked (showing all)

#### 4. Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Duplicate token type badges appearing
- **Fixed**: Website tiers showing "LOW" instead of "TRASH"
- **Fixed**: Social filters showing selected but not filtering
- **Fixed**: Missing tier mapping function after Edge Function update

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-website-analyzer/index.ts` - Updated tier classification
- `/krom-analysis-app/components/ColumnSettings.tsx` - Added granular display controls
- `/krom-analysis-app/components/RecentCalls.tsx` - Implemented new visibility settings
- `/krom-analysis-app/app/page.tsx` - Fixed social filter defaults
- `/mockups/website-analysis-display-options.html` - Created design options

#### API Testing Examples
```bash
# Find tokens needing analysis
curl -X GET "https://eucfoommxxvqmmwdbkdv.supabase.co/rest/v1/crypto_calls?select=id,ticker,website_url&website_url=not.is.null&website_score=is.null"

# Analyze a token
curl -X POST "https://eucfoommxxvqmmwdbkdv.supabase.co/functions/v1/crypto-website-analyzer" \
  -d '{"callId": "ID", "ticker": "TICKER", "url": "URL"}'
```

### Next Session Tasks
1. **Test Website Analyzer**: Analyze 5-10 tokens to verify scoring and tier assignment
2. **Orchestrator Integration**: Add website analysis to the pipeline after X analysis
3. **Notification Updates**: Include website scores in Telegram messages
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Check Edge Function execution times

### Session Stats
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Deployments**: 6 (Edge Function: 1, Frontend: 5)
- **Database Updates**: 8 tokens migrated to new tier system
- **Lines Changed**: ~500 across multiple files

## August 15, 2025 (Later Session) - Website Analysis with Kimi K2 Optimization

### Overview
Optimized the comprehensive website analyzer to use Kimi K2 exclusively after discovering it's 10x cheaper ($0.003 vs $0.03+) while maintaining accuracy. Fixed UI display issues and prepared batch processing for 304 utility tokens from Supabase.

### Technical Implementation

#### Kimi K2 Validation
- Tested Kimi K2 with parsed website content (previously it tried direct browsing)
- Results proved accurate: correctly identified 8 team members for GAI, 10 for TRWA
- Scores aligned with other models when given parsed content
- Decision: Use Kimi K2 exclusively for cost efficiency

#### Database and UI Fixes
1. **Fixed N/A ticker display**:
   - Issue: API was trying to JOIN with non-existent `tokens` table
   - Solution: Modified `comprehensive_results_server.py` to read ticker directly from `website_analysis` table
   - Updated all existing records with correct tickers from Supabase

2. **Populated missing analysis details**:
   - Issue: Manual save function only stored basic data (score, no reasoning)
   - Solution: Re-analyzed tokens with full analysis pipeline
   - Updated database with reasoning, technical_depth, team_transparency fields

#### Batch Analyzer Setup
Created `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` that:
- Pulls utility tokens from Supabase (where `analysis_token_type = 'utility'`)
- Found 308 unique websites (304 still to analyze)
- Orders by liquidity (highest first)
- Saves ticker information with analyses
- Estimated cost: $0.91 for all 304 sites

### Key Discoveries

#### Analysis Prompt Bias
Current prompt in `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` is too heavily weighted on team transparency:
- Most tokens score 2-3/10 simply for lacking visible teams
- Binary scoring: 7/10 with team, 2-3/10 without
- Missing evaluation of technical infrastructure, documentation, tokenomics

#### Actual Token Counts
- Supabase has 308 unique utility token websites (not 128 as in local SQLite)
- Identified using `analysis_token_type` OR `x_analysis_token_type = 'utility'`
- 80 tokens where both AIs agree it's utility
- 220 where only call analysis says utility
- 112 where only X analysis says utility

### Files Modified
- `comprehensive_results_server.py` - Fixed ticker display, now reads from local table
- `comprehensive_website_analyzer.py` - Defaults to Kimi K2 only
- `update_existing_records.py` - Script to populate missing tickers
- `batch_analyze_supabase_utility.py` - Production batch analyzer with liquidity ordering

### Production Ready
- ✅ UI displays tickers correctly
- ✅ Batch analyzer configured for Kimi K2 ($0.003/site)
- ✅ 304 utility token websites ready to analyze
- ✅ Estimated 1.5 hours to complete full batch
- ⚠️ Need to refine scoring prompt for better balance

### Next Steps
1. Run batch analysis on 304 utility tokens
2. Refine prompt to reduce team transparency bias
3. Consider weighted scoring across all factors
4. Add progress tracking to batch analyzer

## August 15, 2025 - Stage 1 Website Analysis Triage System

### Overview
Successfully built Stage 1 website analysis system that evaluates crypto project websites with a 21-point scoring system (7 categories × 3 points each). System uses AI to rapidly triage thousands of projects, identifying those worth deeper investigation.
