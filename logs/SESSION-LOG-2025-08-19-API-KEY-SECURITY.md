# Session Log: API Key Security & Token Website Analysis
**Date**: August 19, 2025
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Status**: Completed

## Critical Security Incident Resolved

### OpenRouter API Key Exposure
- **Issue**: OpenRouter detected API key ending in `...b371` exposed in public GitHub repo
- **Location**: Multiple files in `temp-website-analysis/` directory
- **Action Taken**: 
  - Key already disabled by OpenRouter
  - Removed hardcoded keys from 16 files
  - Added security rules to CLAUDE.md

### Other Exposed Keys Found
- ScrapFly API key (account cancelled)
- ScraperAPI key (rotated to new key: c59a163d35b6cbe5409f1b3b1433e3c6)

### Security Rules Added to CLAUDE.md
```markdown
üîê **CRITICAL SECURITY RULES** üîê
- **NEVER hardcode API keys in Python/JS files** - Always use `os.getenv()` in Python or `process.env` in JavaScript
- **Check before committing**: Always run `git diff --staged | grep -E "sk-|api_key|API_KEY|scp-live"` before pushing
- **Use .gitignore** for sensitive files - Add any files with keys to `.gitignore` immediately
- **Use Supabase/Netlify secrets** for production deployments instead of hardcoding credentials
```

## Token Website Analysis Completion

### Starting Point
- 181 tokens analyzed from previous session
- 264 total tokens with websites in database
- ~71 tokens remaining to analyze

### Analysis Methods Attempted
1. **ScrapFly** - Account cancelled due to exposed API key
2. **ScraperAPI** - Severe timeout issues even with new key
3. **Playwright** - Working but very slow (2-3 min/token)
4. **Fast Hybrid Analyzer** - Created new efficient solution

### Final Results
- **218 tokens analyzed** (37 new tokens processed)
- **18 qualified for Stage 2** investment analysis (8% pass rate)
- **11 high-scoring projects** (score ‚â•10/21)
- **Average score**: 4.1/21 (most are low-quality memes)

### Stage 2 Qualified Tokens
**Top Performers (15/21):** AERO, XNY
**Strong Candidates (14/21):** FLIP, GHST, PUBLIC
**Qualified (10-13/21):** ALTT, BRG, CNET, DUCKAI, ITHACA, MARGIN, plus 7 others

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `scraperapi_fixed_analyzer.py` - Updated with env variables
- `fast_hybrid_analyzer.py` - New efficient analyzer
- `playwright_resilient_analyzer.py` - Timeout-resilient version
- Multiple files cleaned of hardcoded API keys

### Server Status
- Token discovery viewer running at http://localhost:5007
- Shows all 218 analyzed tokens with scores and Stage 2 recommendations

## Lessons Learned
1. **Never commit hardcoded API keys** - Always use environment variables
2. **Check git diffs before pushing** - Use grep to catch exposed keys
3. **ScraperAPI is unreliable** - Consider alternatives for web scraping
4. **Simple HTTP requests often sufficient** - Many sites don't need JS rendering

## Next Session Notes
- ~46 tokens still unanalyzed (264 total - 218 analyzed)
- Consider implementing Stage 2 deeper analysis for qualified tokens
- May need alternative to ScraperAPI for future web scraping
- Token discovery system still finding new tokens with websites daily
