## Session: Analysis Counters & Price Fetching Migration - July 24, 2025

### Overview
Added comprehensive analysis progress counters to the UI and migrated price fetching from Netlify to Supabase Edge Functions for better performance and reliability.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Analysis Progress Counters**
   - Created `/api/analysis-counts` endpoint returning total calls, call analysis, X analysis, and price fetch counts
   - Added visual counters to main header showing:
     - Call Analysis: 4,664/5,434 (85.8%)
     - X Analysis: 1,339/5,434 (24.6%)
     - Prices Fetched: 363/5,434 (6.7%)
   - Counters update automatically after each analysis or price fetch

2. **Price Fetching Cron Job Setup**
   - Initially configured for Netlify with 10-token batches (timeout constraints)
   - Set up cron-job.org to run every minute with 60-second timeout
   - Created Job ID 6384130 "KROM Price Fetch"

3. **Migration to Supabase Edge Functions**
   - Created `crypto-price-fetcher` Edge Function with 150-second timeout
   - Increased batch size from 10 to 50 tokens per run
   - Reduced delay between API calls to 1 second
   - Performance improvement: 3,000 tokens/hour vs 600 tokens/hour
   - Deployment URL: `https://eucfoommxxvqmmwdbkdv.supabase.co/functions/v1/crypto-price-fetcher`

4. **Technical Details**
   - Fixed environment variable issues in batch-price-fetch endpoint
   - Updated column names from `call_ai_analysis_score` to `analysis_score`
   - Handled GeckoTerminal API rate limits and 404 errors gracefully
   - Tested successfully: 50 tokens processed in 70 seconds

### Key Decisions
- Chose Supabase Edge Functions over Netlify for longer timeout (150s vs 10s)
- Kept conservative 1-second delay between API calls to avoid rate limiting
- Used existing batch endpoint logic rather than rewriting from scratch

### Files Modified
- `/app/api/analysis-counts/route.ts` - Added price statistics
- `/app/page.tsx` - Added counter display in header
- `/app/api/cron/price-fetch/route.ts` - Created cron wrapper
- `/app/api/batch-price-fetch/route.ts` - Fixed env vars and columns
- `/edge-functions/crypto-price-fetcher.ts` - New Supabase function
- `/edge-functions/_shared/cors.ts` - CORS headers for edge functions

### Current State
- All 3 cron jobs active: Call Analysis, X Analysis, Price Fetching
- Price fetching will complete all 5,069 remaining tokens in ~2 hours
- Progress visible in real-time through UI counters

## Session: Token Price Tracking with GeckoTerminal API - July 23, 2025

### Overview
Implemented comprehensive token price tracking functionality using the GeckoTerminal API. This enables fetching historical prices, calculating ROI, and displaying market cap data for analyzed tokens.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **GeckoTerminal API Integration**
   - Created `lib/geckoterminal.ts` with comprehensive API client
   - Supports fetching current price, historical price at timestamp, and ATH since date
   - Handles rate limiting with built-in delays (30 calls/minute for free tier)
   - Auto-detects network (Ethereum/Solana) from contract address

2. **Market Cap Calculations**
   - Initially used raw token supply Ã— price (caused inflated values)
   - Fixed to use API-provided market caps and proportional calculations
   - Simplified to FDV-focused approach for reliability
   - Formula: `historicalFDV = (historicalPrice / currentPrice) Ã— currentFDV`

3. **Database Schema Updates**
   ```sql
   -- Added 10 new columns for price tracking
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN price_at_call NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN current_price NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN ath_price NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN ath_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN roi_percent NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN ath_roi_percent NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN market_cap_at_call NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN current_market_cap NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN ath_market_cap NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN fdv_at_call NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN current_fdv NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN ath_fdv NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN token_supply NUMERIC;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN price_network TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE crypto_calls ADD COLUMN price_fetched_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
   ```

4. **API Endpoints Created**
   - `/api/token-price` - Fetches all three price points for a single token
   - `/api/batch-price-fetch` - Batch processes multiple tokens (respects rate limits)
   - `/api/save-price-data` - Saves fetched price data to database

5. **UI Components**
   - Created `PriceDisplay` component showing:
     - Entry, Current, and ATH market caps (FDV)
     - ROI percentages with color coding
     - Native HTML tooltips for price on hover
   - Removed Radix UI tooltips due to sticky behavior bug

### Technical Implementation

#### Market Cap Calculation Evolution

Initial (buggy) approach:
```typescript
// Used raw token supply without decimal adjustment
const marketCap = price * parseFloat(tokenInfo.total_supply);
// Result: Inflated values in billions/trillions
```

Fixed approach:
```typescript
// Use API-provided market caps when available
const currentFDV = tokenInfo.fdv_usd || null;

// Calculate historical values proportionally
if (currentFDV && currentPrice && currentPrice > 0) {
  if (priceAtCall) {
    fdvAtCall = (priceAtCall / currentPrice) * currentFDV;
  }
  if (athData?.price) {
    athFDV = (athData.price / currentPrice) * currentFDV;
  }
}
```

#### Price Display Component
```typescript
// Simplified to show FDV as primary metric
<div title={`Price: ${formatPrice(priceData.priceAtCall)}`}>
  <span>Entry:</span>
  <span>{formatMarketCap(priceData.fdvAtCall || priceData.marketCapAtCall)}</span>
</div>
```

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Market Cap Inflation Bug**
   - Problem: Raw token supplies weren't decimal-adjusted
   - Solution: Use API-provided values and calculate proportionally

2. **Sticky Tooltip Issue**
   - Problem: Radix UI tooltips wouldn't close after hover
   - Solution: Removed Radix tooltips, use native HTML title attribute

3. **Missing Historical Data**
   - Problem: GeckoTerminal doesn't always have historical prices
   - Solution: Return null gracefully, show N/A in UI

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Problem: Free tier limited to 30 calls/minute
   - Solution: Added 2-second delay between batch operations

### Files Changed

**Created:**
- `/lib/geckoterminal.ts` - API client library
- `/components/price-display.tsx` - Price display component
- `/app/api/token-price/route.ts` - Single token price endpoint
- `/app/api/batch-price-fetch/route.ts` - Batch processing endpoint
- `/app/api/save-price-data/route.ts` - Database save endpoint

**Modified:**
- `/app/page.tsx` - Added PriceDisplay to table
- `/app/api/analyzed/route.ts` - Include price data in response
- Database schema - Added 15 price-related columns

**Removed:**
- `/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` - Due to sticky tooltip bug

### Current State
- âœ… Price tracking fully operational
- âœ… Market cap calculations accurate
- âœ… UI displays FDV with native tooltips
- âœ… Batch processing respects rate limits
- ðŸ“Š Ready to fetch prices for 5,000+ analyzed tokens

### Next Steps (for future sessions)
- Monitor GeckoTerminal API usage and rate limits
- Consider caching strategy for frequently accessed tokens
- Add historical price charts visualization
- Implement price alerts for significant ROI changes

## Session: Price Display Improvements & GeckoTerminal Panel - July 23, 2025 (Continued)

### Overview
Enhanced the token price tracking functionality with improved UI, better error handling, and added a GeckoTerminal chart panel for investigating tokens directly within the app.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Fixed N/A Price Display Issues**
   - Identified root cause: Rate limiting and missing `price_fetched_at` column check
   - Added proper null checks before displaying price data
   - Implemented refetch functionality for tokens with N/A prices
   - Added 2-second delay between API calls to respect rate limits

2. **"Fetch All Prices" Button Implementation**
   - Created button that programmatically clicks all individual fetch buttons
   - Processes tokens sequentially with proper delays
   - Shows loading state during batch processing
   - Prevents duplicate fetches for tokens with existing price data

3. **GeckoTerminal Chart Panel**
   - Added new expandable panel below X Analysis panel
   - Embeds live GeckoTerminal charts for any token
   - Automatically constructs correct URL based on network (ETH/SOL)
   - Uses contract address from `raw_data.token.ca`
   - Full-width iframe (100% width, 600px height)

4. **Refetch Functionality**
   - Added refetch button specifically for N/A prices
   - Only shows for tokens where price fetch previously failed
   - Respects rate limits with built-in delays
   - Updates UI immediately after successful fetch

5. **Price Info Display Enhancement**
   - Added descriptive text to GeckoTerminal panel
   - Shows "View live charts and trading data on GeckoTerminal"
   - Helps users understand the panel's purpose

### Technical Implementation

#### Fetch All Prices Logic
```typescript
const handleFetchAllPrices = async () => {
  setIsFetchingAll(true);
  const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('[data-fetch-price="true"]');
  
  for (const button of Array.from(buttons)) {
    if (button instanceof HTMLButtonElement) {
      button.click();
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    }
  }
  
  setIsFetchingAll(false);
};
```

#### GeckoTerminal Panel Component
```typescript
{showGeckoTerminal && (
  <div className="border rounded-lg p-4 bg-gray-900">
    <div className="flex justify-between items-center mb-2">
      <h3 className="font-semibold">GeckoTerminal Chart</h3>
      <button onClick={() => setShowGeckoTerminal(false)}>Ã—</button>
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mb-4">
      View live charts and trading data on GeckoTerminal
    </p>
    <iframe
      src={getGeckoTerminalUrl(selectedCall)}
      className="w-full h-[600px] rounded border border-gray-700"
      title="GeckoTerminal Chart"
    />
  </div>
)}
```

#### Network Detection for URLs
```typescript
const getGeckoTerminalUrl = (call: AnalyzedCall) => {
  const contractAddress = call.raw_data?.token?.ca;
  const network = contractAddress?.length === 44 ? 'solana' : 'eth';
  return `https://www.geckoterminal.com/${network}/pools/${contractAddress}`;
};
```

### Bug Fixes

1. **Price Display Null Checks**
   - Added conditional rendering: `priceData && priceData.price_fetched_at`
   - Prevents "Cannot read properties of null" errors
   - Shows fetch button instead of broken price display

2. **Rate Limiting Handling**
   - Increased delay between fetches from 1s to 2s
   - Added explicit error handling for 429 responses
   - Prevents cascade of failed requests

3. **Network Detection**
   - Fixed Solana address detection (44 chars vs 42 for ETH)
   - Ensures correct GeckoTerminal URL construction

### UI/UX Improvements

1. **Button States**
   - "Fetch All Prices" shows loading spinner when active
   - Individual buttons disable during fetch
   - Clear visual feedback for all operations

2. **Panel Organization**
   - GeckoTerminal panel positioned after X Analysis
   - Consistent styling with other expandable panels
   - Close button (Ã—) for easy dismissal

3. **Informative Text**
   - Added helper text to explain panel purposes
   - Consistent messaging across all features

### Current State
- âœ… Price fetching works reliably with proper rate limiting
- âœ… N/A prices can be refetched individually
- âœ… Batch price fetching via "Fetch All" button
- âœ… GeckoTerminal integration for chart viewing
- âœ… All UI components properly handle null states

### Files Modified
- `/app/page.tsx` - Added Fetch All button, GeckoTerminal panel, fixed null checks
- `/components/price-display.tsx` - Enhanced with refetch capability
- No new files created (all changes to existing components)

### Next Steps (for future sessions)
- Consider adding price alerts when ROI exceeds thresholds
- Implement price history graphs within the app
- Add export functionality for price data
- Consider caching recent price fetches

## Session: Automated Analysis Setup & Cron Job Implementation - July 23, 2025 (Continued)

### Overview
Successfully set up automated cron jobs for processing the entire KROM database with both call and X analysis. Resolved timeout issues and optimized batch processing for reliability.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Cron Job Setup via API**
   - Used cron-job.org API key from .env file
   - Created two cron jobs:
     - Job ID 6380042: Call Analysis (every minute)
     - Job ID 6380045: X Analysis (every minute)
   - Both jobs configured with proper auth tokens

2. **Timeout Issues Resolved**
   - Identified jobs were auto-disabling due to 28+ second execution times
   - Increased timeout from default to 60 seconds for both jobs
   - Reduced X analysis batch size from 5 to 3 for better reliability
   - Jobs now complete in 25-28 seconds (well under limit)

3. **Progress Achieved**
   - Call Analysis: 4,397 / 5,417 (81% complete)
   - X Analysis: 866 / 5,417 (15% complete)
   - Both jobs running continuously without intervention

### Technical Implementation

**Cron Job Creation:**
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.cron-job.org/jobs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job": {
      "url": "https://lively-torrone-8199e0.netlify.app/api/cron/analyze?auth=[CRON_SECRET]",
      "enabled": "true",
      "title": "KROM Analysis App - Call Analysis",
      "schedule": {
        "type": 0,
        "minutes": [-1],
        "hours": [-1]
      },
      "requestMethod": 0
    }
  }'
```

**Timeout Configuration:**
```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.cron-job.org/jobs/[JOB_ID]" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]" \
  -d '{"job": {"requestTimeout": 60}}'
```

**X Batch Size Reduction:**
- Modified `/app/api/cron/x-analyze/route.ts`
- Changed from `const limit = 5` to `const limit = 3`

### Current State
- âœ… Both cron jobs active and processing
- âœ… No timeout errors
- âœ… Processing rate: 5 calls/min + 3 X analyses/min
- ðŸ“Š ETA: ~3.4 hours for calls, ~25 hours for X analysis

### Files Modified
- `krom-analysis-app/app/api/cron/x-analyze/route.ts` - Reduced batch size

### Next Session Notes
- Monitor completion of database processing
- Both cron jobs will continue running automatically
- When complete, they'll return "No calls need analysis"
- Consider implementing progress dashboard for monitoring

---
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour
**Key Achievement**: Automated processing of entire database
**Status**: Both cron jobs running continuously

## Session: Price Display Fix & ATH Restoration - July 24, 2025 (Evening)

### Overview
Fixed critical price display issues where Entry/Now prices appeared identical and ATH showed N/A for all tokens. Restored the original ATH functionality from GitHub history.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Diagnosed Price Display Issues**
   - Identified that Entry/Now prices were actually different but appeared identical due to rounding
   - Example: VIRUS $0.0030864836 vs $0.003086483645 both display as $3.09M
   - Found ATH was incorrectly setting current price as ATH price

2. **Fixed Price Counter Display**
   - API was counting `price_at_call` instead of `current_price`
   - Updated `/api/analysis-counts/route.ts` to check correct column
   - Counter now correctly shows 388+ prices fetched (was stuck at 367)

3. **Restored Proper ATH Functionality**
   - Reviewed GitHub history to find original implementation in `lib/geckoterminal.ts`
   - Restored `getATHSinceTimestamp` method that:
     - Fetches historical OHLCV data from GeckoTerminal
     - Searches daily/hourly candles for highest price since call
     - Properly calculates ATH FDV based on price ratios
   - Edge Function now takes ~42s (vs 25s) due to historical data fetching

4. **Database Cleanup**
   - Cleared 364 incorrect ATH entries where ATH = current price
   - Fixed astronomical ATH FDV values (billions/trillions)

### Technical Implementation

#### ATH Restoration in Edge Function
```typescript
// Added methods to fetch historical data
async getTokenPools(network: string, address: string)
async getHistoricalOHLCV(network, poolAddress, timeframe, aggregate, beforeTimestamp, limit)
async getATHSinceTimestamp(network, tokenAddress, sinceTimestamp)

// Fetches OHLCV data in batches going backwards
while (currentTimestamp > sinceTimestamp && allOHLCV.length < 1000) {
  const batch = await this.getHistoricalOHLCV(network, poolAddress, 'day', 1, currentTimestamp, 365);
  // Process and find highest price
}
```

#### Price Counter Fix
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
.not('price_at_call', 'is', null)

// After (correct)
.not('current_price', 'is', null)
```

### Current State
- âœ… Price counters showing correct values
- âœ… ATH functionality restored and working
- âœ… Edge Function processing 20 tokens/minute with ATH data
- âœ… Cron job (ID: 6384378) running successfully
- ðŸ“Š 10+ tokens already have ATH data populated

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-price-fetcher/index.ts` - Restored ATH functionality
- `/app/api/analysis-counts/route.ts` - Fixed price counter
- Deployed updates to both Netlify and Supabase

---
**Session Duration**: ~1 hour
**Key Achievement**: Restored proper ATH price tracking
**Status**: All systems operational
