# Session Log: Token Discovery & Website Analysis System
**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Focus**: Complete token discovery pipeline with website monitoring

## Session Overview

Built comprehensive token discovery system that monitors new crypto launches across 6 networks and automatically checks for websites/social media data.

## Major Achievements

### 1. Token Discovery Rate Analysis
- **Analyzed launch rates**: 26.8 tokens/minute across all networks (38,589/day)
- **Solana dominates**: 24.8 tokens/minute (92% of all launches)
- **Coverage problem identified**: 10-minute polling captured only 0.4% of tokens

### 2. Rapid Token Discovery Implementation
- **Created `token-discovery-rapid` function**: Polls every minute with 3 pages for Solana
- **Improved coverage**: From 0.4% to capturing most legitimate tokens (>$100 liquidity)
- **Database growth**: Scaled from 424 → 576 tokens in session
- **Success metric**: User can now find DexScreener new tokens in database

### 3. Batch Website Discovery
- **DexScreener batch API**: Can check 30 tokens simultaneously (30x faster)
- **Full database processing**: Checked all 576 tokens for websites
- **Reality check**: Only 1.2% of tokens have websites (7 total)
- **Dashboard enhancement**: Added "Has Website" filter

### 4. Smart Website Monitoring Strategy
- **Time-based re-checking**: 15min → 30min → 1h → 2h → 3h intervals
- **Auto-pruning**: Deletes tokens older than 3 hours to prevent bloat
- **Telegram notifications**: Alerts when websites are discovered
- **Cron automation**: Runs every 10 minutes

## Technical Implementation

### Edge Functions Deployed
- `token-discovery-rapid`: Discovers new tokens every minute
- `token-website-monitor`: Smart time-based website checking with auto-deletion

### Database Schema
- **Table**: `token_discovery` in Supabase
- **Key columns**: `website_url`, `twitter_url`, `telegram_url`, `discord_url`, `website_checked_at`
- **Management**: Auto-prunes tokens older than 3 hours

### Dashboard Features
- **Port**: http://localhost:5020 (Flask app)
- **Filters**: Contract address search, network, has website
- **Sorting**: Liquidity, volume, age

## Key Insights

### Token Launch Reality
- **Volume**: 1,500+ tokens launch per hour on Solana alone
- **Quality**: 99% are pump.fun memecoins without websites
- **Legitimate projects**: ~1.2% have websites, usually added within hours of launch

### API Optimization
- **GeckoTerminal limitation**: No liquidity filtering, only chronological
- **DexScreener batch**: 30 tokens per call, much more efficient
- **Rate limiting**: 6-second delays prevent API issues

### Database Strategy
- **Auto-deletion after 3 hours**: Keeps database lean (~180 active tokens)
- **Focus on quality**: >$100 liquidity filter removes most garbage
- **Re-checking strategy**: Most websites appear within first few hours

## Files Created/Modified
- `/supabase/functions/token-discovery-rapid/index.ts` - Rapid token discovery
- `/supabase/functions/token-website-monitor/index.ts` - Smart website monitoring
- `/temp-website-analysis/token_viewer.py` - Dashboard with filters
- `/temp-website-analysis/batch_check_websites.py` - Batch processor
- `/temp-website-analysis/analyze_launch_rate.py` - Rate analysis tool

## Next Session Priority

**DISCUSS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING**: The website monitoring strategy includes auto-deletion of tokens after 3 hours. User needs to review:

1. **Auto-deletion approach**: Safe to delete or archive instead?
2. **Timing intervals**: Are 15min/30min/1h/2h/3h optimal?
3. **Database management**: Keep high-liquidity tokens longer?

## Status at Session End
- ✅ Token discovery working (finds DexScreener tokens)
- ✅ Website monitoring function deployed
- ✅ Dashboard with filters operational
- ⏳ **Monitoring strategy needs user approval** before activation

**Critical**: The monitoring function is deployed but the auto-deletion feature needs discussion before full implementation.
