# Session Log - August 19, 2025 (Session 3)
## Website Analysis Production Integration

### Session Overview
Successfully resolved production issues with website analysis system, implemented retry logic, and enhanced UI functionality.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Fixed API Key Security Issues
- **Problem**: OpenRouter API key was exposed in GitHub repository
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed hardcoded keys from repository
  - Updated Supabase secrets with valid API key
  - Added security rules to CLAUDE.md

#### 2. Implemented Retry Logic for Failed Websites
- **Challenge**: Database constraint prevented 'FAILED' tier
- **Workaround**: 
  - Use `website_score = -1` with `website_tier = 'TRASH'`
  - Special reasoning text: "ANALYSIS FAILED: [error]"
  - UI checks for score = -1 and displays "W: FAILED" in red

#### 3. Enhanced Website Analysis Processing
- **Timeout increased**: From 45s to 60s for slow-loading sites
- **Prioritization fixed**: Batch processor now orders by `created_at DESC`
- **Queue management**: Processes newest tokens first to sync with orchestrator

#### 4. Added Website Score Sorting
- **New sort option**: "Website Score" in dropdown menu
- **Smart filtering**: Excludes NULL values when sorting
- **Backend support**: Added special handling in `/api/recent-calls/route.ts`

### Technical Details

#### Database Workaround for Failed Analyses
```typescript
// Edge Function marks failures as:
{
  website_score: -1,  // Special indicator
  website_tier: 'TRASH',  // Allowed by constraint
  website_analysis_reasoning: 'ANALYSIS FAILED: [error]'
}
```

#### UI Detection for Failed Sites
```tsx
// RecentCalls.tsx displays FAILED when score = -1
W: {call.website_score === -1 ? 'FAILED' : call.website_tier}
```

### Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/crypto-website-analyzer-batch/index.ts`
- `/krom-analysis-app/components/RecentCalls.tsx`
- `/krom-analysis-app/components/sort-dropdown.tsx`
- `/krom-analysis-app/app/api/recent-calls/route.ts`

### Issues Resolved
1. ✅ OpenRouter API key invalid (replaced with working key)
2. ✅ ScraperAPI key updated
3. ✅ Database constraint blocking FAILED tier (workaround implemented)
4. ✅ Website sorting showing NULL values first (fixed with filtering)
5. ✅ YZY not showing as FAILED (manually updated, system fixed)

### Testing Results
- Successfully analyzed multiple batches of tokens
- Failed websites properly marked (YZY, BEAN, PEPE)
- Sorting by Website Score only shows analyzed tokens
- 60-second timeout adequate for most sites

### Next Session Plan
Implement fullscreen modal for detailed website analysis display:
- Adapt local UI from `/temp-website-analysis/`
- Create React modal with iframe and analysis details
- Make scores/tags clickable to open modal

### Session Stats
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Tokens Analyzed**: 15+ websites
- **Success Rate**: 80% (4/5 in typical batch)
- **Deployments**: 3 Supabase functions, 3 Netlify builds
