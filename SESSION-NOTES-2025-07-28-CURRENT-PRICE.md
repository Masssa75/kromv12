# Current Price Implementation Session - July 28, 2025

## CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. Price Display Fix Completed ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: UI was showing market cap values ($7.65K) instead of actual token prices ($0.00000765)
- **Solution**: Updated `krom-analysis-app/components/price-display.tsx` to always show simple price format
- **Deployed**: Live at https://lively-torrone-8199e0.netlify.app
- **Commit**: "feat: update PriceDisplay to always show actual token prices instead of market caps"

### 2. Network Mapping Issue FIXED ‚úÖ
**CRITICAL**: KROM stores `"ethereum"` but GeckoTerminal API requires `"eth"`
```python
network_map = {
    'ethereum': 'eth',
    'solana': 'solana',
    'bsc': 'bsc',
    'polygon': 'polygon',
    'arbitrum': 'arbitrum',
    'base': 'base'
}
mapped_network = network_map.get(network, network)
```
- **Impact**: Success rate improved from 52% to 84% after fix!

### 3. Current Price Storage
- **Column to use**: `current_price` (NOT `price_current` which has 0 records)
- **Timestamp column**: `price_updated_at`
- **Edge function**: `crypto-price-single` at `{SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/crypto-price-single`

### 4. Scripts Created This Session
```
/fetch-current-prices-batch.py              # Main batch processor (updated with network mapping)
/fetch-current-prices-oldest-10.py          # Test script for oldest 10 tokens
/fetch-next-25-tokens.py                    # Process 25 tokens at a time
/test-current-price-edge-function.py        # Edge function tester
/test-ethereum-tokens-fixed.py              # Ethereum network mapping tester
/test-mr-lean-timeline.py                   # Dead token investigation
/test-mr-lean-original-timestamp.py         # Historical price investigation
/fetch-current-prices-dexscreener.py        # DexScreener API version (avoids GeckoTerminal rate limits)
/fetch-current-prices-dexscreener-simple.py # Simple one-token-at-a-time processor
/fetch-current-prices-dexscreener-fixed.py  # Fixed version with exclusion tracking
/run-dexscreener-batch.sh                   # Batch runner shell script
/check-current-price-progress.py            # Progress checker
/check-bip177-status.py                     # BIP177 specific status check
/test-dexscreener-api.py                    # DexScreener API test
```

### 5. Current Progress
- ‚úÖ Successfully fetched current price for BIP177 (one of the oldest tokens)
- üìä BIP177: Entry price $0.00029889 ‚Üí Current price $0.00001150 (ROI: -96.2%)
- üìä Typical pattern for old meme coins: massive losses (80-96% down)
- üéØ DexScreener API working well as alternative to GeckoTerminal

### 6. Dead Token Discovery
- Many tokens show as "dead" (no current price) but DO have historical prices
- Example: MR.LEAN has entry price of $0.0003646608 but shows no current data
- Pattern: Tokens were alive when called but liquidity removed/delisted since
- Success rate ~84% after network mapping fix

### 7. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Fix the duplicate processing issue**: BIP177 kept being returned even after update
   - Likely need to add better exclusion logic or use a different query approach
   - Consider using `price_updated_at` timestamp to exclude recently updated tokens
2. **Continue batch processing**: Process remaining ~5,600+ tokens needing current prices
3. **Consider automation**: Set up cron job for continuous price updates
4. **Implement UI refresh strategy**: Prices older than 6 hours should auto-refresh
5. **ROI calculations**: Already implemented in batch scripts

### 8. UI Refresh Strategy (Not Yet Implemented)
Proposed approach:
- Auto-refresh when prices > 6 hours old
- Manual refresh button for immediate updates
- Show timestamp on hover (already implemented)

### 9. Important Notes
- The `fetch-current-prices-dexscreener.py` script works well to avoid rate limits
- DexScreener API doesn't require authentication and has generous limits
- Network mapping is CRITICAL for Ethereum tokens
- GitHub push failed but Netlify deploy worked directly

### 10. Known Issues
- **BIP177 Loop**: The query kept returning BIP177 even after updating it
  - This suggests Supabase might have query caching or the `current_price.is.null` condition isn't working as expected
  - Consider using a different approach like tracking processed tokens in memory or using timestamp filters

## TO CONTINUE NEXT SESSION:

### CRITICAL FIX NEEDED:
The `clear-prices` API is causing the issue! It clears price fields but NOT the timestamp fields.
- **Problem**: 5,701 records have `price_updated_at` timestamps but NULL `current_price`
- **Cause**: `/api/clear-prices/route.ts` doesn't clear `price_updated_at` or `price_fetched_at`
- **Fix**: Update the API to also clear these timestamps (see `route-FIXED.ts`)

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ BIP177 successfully updated: $0.0000115 (ROI: -96.15%)
- ‚úÖ BIP177 exists 3+ times in database (duplicate issue confirmed)
- ‚úÖ Network mapping implemented and working
- ‚úÖ DexScreener API working as alternative to GeckoTerminal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5,701 records have timestamps but null prices (from clear-prices bug)

### Scripts Created:
1. **fetch-current-prices-smart.py** - Properly handles cleared prices
   - Queries for tokens with null prices regardless of timestamp
   - Uses DexScreener to avoid rate limits
   - Includes proper error handling

### To Do:
1. **Deploy the clear-prices fix**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the fixed version
   cp krom-analysis-app/app/api/clear-prices/route-FIXED.ts krom-analysis-app/app/api/clear-prices/route.ts
   # Commit and deploy
   git add -A && git commit -m "fix: clear timestamps when clearing prices" && git push
   ```

2. **Run the smart batch processor**:
   ```bash
   python3 fetch-current-prices-smart.py
   ```

3. **Consider cleaning up the timestamp-only records**:
   ```sql
   -- Optional: Clear timestamps for records with null prices
   UPDATE crypto_calls 
   SET price_updated_at = NULL, price_fetched_at = NULL 
   WHERE current_price IS NULL AND price_updated_at IS NOT NULL;
   ```

Monitor progress and adjust approach as needed.
