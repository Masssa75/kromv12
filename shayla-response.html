    <h2>Response to Shayla (Public Community Chat)</h2>
    <div class="message-box" id="message">Hi @ShaylaShayla, I'm sorry for my late response.
<br><br>
To answer your question - because pivoting is such a crucial part of both crypto and successful innovation companies, this scenario is very common.
<br><br>
For example, Crypto.com started as Monaco (MCO), a simple crypto card project with one token model. When they pivoted to become a broader platform, they completely redesigned their tokenomics - early MCO investors were migrated to CRO tokens and benefited from the company finding its true market fit. Similarly, 1inch started as a hackathon project with no token at all, pivoted multiple times, then designed their tokenomics specifically for what they'd become - early supporters received generous retroactive rewards when they found success. The pattern is consistent: teams that can adapt survive and eventually reward their early believers.
<br><br>
In our case, your investment in Cyrator has funded the development journey that continues today. While the form has evolved through market conditions, the core mission - finding quality in crypto - remains. Cyrator investors are documented and remembered. The standard practice is that when projects achieve meaningful success (regardless of what form that takes), early supporters benefit appropriately within regulatory constraints.
<br><br>
Thank you for your patience and for being part of this journey from the beginning.</div>
