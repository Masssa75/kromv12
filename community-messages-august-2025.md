# Community Messages & Updates - August 2025

## Overall Situation & Context

### Project Evolution
- **Multiple pivots**: CyberWriter → Cyrator → Cura → Cura DAO → KROM
- **Core mission unchanged**: Finding quality crypto projects, cutting through the noise
- **Last 6 months**: Marc has been quiet, focusing intensely on mastering AI/vibe coding
- **Current state**: KROM platform showing most promise as crypto intelligence platform

### Why the Silence
- Market shifted to memecoins, making utility/review platforms less relevant
- Traditional development too expensive ($100k+ for prototypes)
- AI coding breakthrough changes everything (costs down to <$1k, 100x faster)
- Been working on partnerships, negotiations that couldn't be disclosed

### Current Plans
- **KROM**: Main focus, needs 2 more weeks for critical features (referral program, enhanced AI analysis, Telegram notifications)
- **Forge Launchpad**: Could work as AI coding launchpad, but needs sustained interest from KROM first
- **Vibe Coding Demo**: 20-minute video showing platform being built, key to getting community excited

### Key Relationships to Manage
- Investors from Cyrator/Crowd who need updates on potential token allocations
- Forge community (NFT holders) expecting returns/utility
- Active community members who've been supporting for years
- New potential partners interested in AI coding capabilities

## Previous Community Update (Reference)
The last major update acknowledged frustrations, explained the pivots, referenced successful pivots (Twitter, Instagram, Slack), discussed the shift to memecoins, and positioned the team as survivors adapting to AI revolution. Key quote: "The crypto space is brutal. Most projects that started when we did are dead. We're still here, still building, still adapting."

### 1. Amir (Small Investor/Community Supporter)
**Context**: $1000 investor, very active community member for 2-3 years, deserves recognition for loyalty

**Message sent**:
```
It showcases what I've been building with AI coding - essentially a complete crypto intelligence platform in under 20 minutes. This is the AI evolution of what we built with Cyrator - cutting through the noise to find the best crypto projects - but now powered by AI and 100x faster to develop.

KROM is already live and analyzing crypto calls, but I'm adding a few critical features over the next 2 weeks - referral program, enhanced AI analysis, and Telegram notifications. Once those are in, we'll be ready to really push. We might even layer something like Cyrator's review system on top at some point.

I'd love to get your thoughts on the demo. I'll update you once these crucial features are implemented and we're ready to start promoting.
```

### 2. PoNW (Forge Community Leader)
**Context**: Pushing for updates and livestream, concerned about lack of communication, offered to CTO the Forge

**His concerns (from July 8)**:
- No updates in months, launchpad still not built
- No projects launched in over a year besides test tokens
- Community complaining about lack of updates
- Offered to CTO the Forge to return value to NFT sacrificers
- Wants revenue share model or DEX partnership for NFT holders

**Marc's detailed response to him (July 17)**: Explained entire Forge history, pivot to Pump.fun style model, AI coding breakthrough reducing costs from $100k to <$1k, RocketApps concept, challenges with PulseChain adoption, working on partnerships with other chains

**Recent messages (August 12-13)**: Sent video demo, he expressed excitement, pushing for livestream to engage community, concerned about another month passing without communication

**Message sent**:
```
Yes I understand, and I would love to get something out asap too. Please let me know once you've had a chance to checkout this video. I personally believe this is a good direction to get things started because ultimately to make the Forge work, we need to get people interested in vibe coding - and I believe that this video could be able to do that.

If you agree that we should post this and it could get people excited, we could then next schedule a live stream where we build a simple tokenized app on lovable (easy for anyone to use) on stream.

Lovable.dev now supports team vibe coding... so we could vibe code the thing together in realtime.

We can also launch a token via the Forge during the stream and integrate it into our app.

The simplest thing to do, which only takes a couple of minutes, is to require people holding a certain amount of tokens in order to access certain parts of the website.

Equally simple is adding a payment, as in send X amount of your tokens to a certain address to access certain features.

Earning stuff and getting tokens is more complicated because it involves smart contracts (also quite easy, but slightly more complex) and anti cheating mechanisms (this is a lot more complex in most cases..)

### 3. Daniil (Cyrator Investor)
**Context**: Had brief 5-min call about KROM, discussed distribution, investor from Cyrator days

**Previous interactions**:
- July 26-29: Scheduled call for Tuesday 4am UTC
- Shared KROM details and mentioned convergence of KROM, Forge, and CROWD using AI coding
- Explained KROM as hub for drawing crowds to give Forge projects exposure
- Offered two paths: A) Community takeover with AI coding focus, or B) Full community takeover
- He responded positively but with concerns about multi-chain approach alienating PulseChain community

**August 12-13**: Brief 5-minute call where Marc showed KROM briefly, Daniil immediately focused on distribution

**Message to send**:
```
Hey Daniil, I've finished the AI coding demo that I have been sending privately to some of my investors. I'm not sure how on top you are with recent developments in AI coding, but I hope that this demo gives you a good sense of what's possible atm.

You already know what kind of data we're processing with KROM since I've presented it to you a few months back. Now we're adding a lot of AI processing to this. In the coming couple of weeks I'm planning to expand the analysis to not just KROM calls, but new dex tokens (via geckoterminal), trending tokens, etc.

I think AI coding is going to be the hottest thing in the coming months and there's an ocean of opportunity out there. That's why I've focused heavily on making sure we're at the absolute forefront of this.

As you mentioned on our brief call, distribution is key. Would love to discuss this properly once you've had a chance to watch the demo.

I'm swamped the rest of this week, but let me know what day works best for you next week for a proper call.
```

### 4. Ralph (Investor)
**Context**: German-speaking investor who shared the demo with others (Gorge, Hermes, Theau, Dominik)

**August 12-13 Exchange**:
- Marc sent KROM demo apologizing for rough editing
- Expressed being "absolutely stunned" by AI coding capabilities with Claude Code
- Ralph responded "Beeindruckend" (Impressive) and forwarded to others
- Ralph planning to try creating his own agent

**Status**: Demo sent, positive response received

### 5. Mike (Problematic Investor - $3K)
**Context**: Small investor who has aggressively pushed for refund despite signed SAFT. Uses any pivot as ammunition for refund requests. Had multiple difficult calls where Marc explained why refunds aren't possible.

**Previous interactions**:
- June: Pushed hard for refund, claimed no clarity on terms
- June 23: Scheduled call at 4:30pm
- July 28: Asked for updates
- July 30: Marc promised extensive community update in coming days

**Message sent (August 15, 2025)**:

Hi Mike,

The best update I can give you is in the AI coding demo I've recently put together and shared with select investors: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHrdj4pB2kADMDpfCNNl_TBuTiFeuPec/view?usp=sharing

In the last 6 months, AI's coding capabilities have skyrocketed. I firmly believe that any project that doesn't fully master this technology will have no chance to compete. That's why I've been completely immersed in this revolution to ensure we're at the absolute forefront. The video demonstrates what's now possible with the right experience, tools, workflow, and creativity. There are also some significant breakthroughs on the horizon that I'll be able to share soon.
```

**Strategy**: Keep it brief, focus on existential shift (not cost/speed benefits), don't mention specific projects to avoid "pivot" arguments, position adaptation as survival necessity

### 6. Shayla (Public Community Response)
**Context**: Cyrator investor who asked publicly if her investment is gone and whether early investors will get credit in future projects

**Her question**: "Since I invested in Cyrator is my money gone? ... are you going to give the people invest in a cyrator Credit, so if the project is successful, we will also recoup our investment?"

**Message sent (August 20, 2025)**:
```
Hi @ShaylaShayla, I'm sorry for my late response.

To answer your question - because pivoting is such a crucial part of both crypto and successful innovation companies, this scenario is very common.

For example, Crypto.com started as Monaco (MCO), a simple crypto card project with one token model. When they pivoted to become a broader platform, they completely redesigned their tokenomics - early MCO investors were migrated to CRO tokens and benefited from the company finding its true market fit. Similarly, 1inch started as a hackathon project with no token at all, pivoted multiple times, then designed their tokenomics specifically for what they'd become - early supporters received generous retroactive rewards when they found success. The pattern is consistent: teams that can adapt survive and eventually reward their early believers.

In our case, your investment in Cyrator has funded the development journey that continues today. While the form has evolved through market conditions, the core mission - finding quality in crypto - remains. Cyrator investors are documented and remembered. The standard practice is that when projects achieve meaningful success (regardless of what form that takes), early supporters benefit appropriately within regulatory constraints.

Thank you for your patience and for being part of this journey from the beginning.
```

**Strategy**: Educational approach using examples of successful pivots, acknowledges investment without legal commitments, uses conditional language throughout, emphasizes tokenomics evolution as normal
