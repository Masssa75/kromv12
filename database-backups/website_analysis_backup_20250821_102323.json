When placed, it deploys a Launch Pad that launches the player into the air, allowing them to deploy their Glider. If being pushed by The Storm, the Launch Pad is a great help in getting out of it, due to the glider redeploy. The Launch Pad can be used to acquire high ground over opponents or to easily flank them due to the high mobility."

Pop the fucking pill isn’t just a line. It’s initiation. The pill separates the ones who move with conviction from the ones still stuck in the herd. When you swallow it, you’re not just joining a project, you’re stepping into a mindset: reckless, raw, and unapologetically early. Ride the podz means you don’t walk this chaos alone. The podz is a pack, a collective of degenerates, prophets, and maniacs who see the game for what it is. Together, we don’t follow trends, we bend them until they break. Alone you’re noise, in the podz you’re signal. “The greatest crimes in the world are not committed by people breaking the rules but by people following the rules.” — Banksy Pill Money Podz isn’t built for rule-followers. Rules are the leash they put on the herd, a script written to keep you quiet, compliant, forgettable. Following it is the real crime. blueprint of madness, pill money podz c.2025 The podz exists to break alignment, to tear up that script and write our own. We don’t worship the system; we corrupt it. We don’t follow the rules; we make them irrelevant. “The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten.” — Benjamin Franklin source: https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1953861787947778362 @a1lon9 source: https://x.com/Adam_Tehc/status/1951950513462804816/photo/1 @Adam_Tehc The meme market has evolved into a hyper-accelerated casino. Coins ignite like fireworks, pumped into existence only to burn out before the smoke even clears. The average holding time is collapsing — weeks became days, days became hours, hours became seconds. What should have been a cultural engine of creativity and collective energy has instead devolved into disposable tokens that vanish faster than they appear. blueprint of madness, pill money podz c.2025 But movements aren’t built on slot machines. They’re built on structure, on meaning, on something that outlives a single green candle. Joseph Beuys once said, “A social organism as a work of art.” That’s the foundation of Pill Money Podz. Each pill is more than a token — it’s a fragment of a collective organism, a living structure shaped by those inside it. This isn’t about chasing dopamine spikes, it’s about creating an enduring signal in the middle of noise. blueprint of madness, pill money podz c.2025 Pill Money Podz is art in motion, not just another ticker, but a living organism made of degenerates, prophets, punks, and visionaries who refuse to play the disposable game. In a market obsessed with speed, we choose depth. In an industry addicted to churn, we choose structure. This is a collective designed not to explode and vanish, but to grow, breathe, and disturb the comfortable. f*ck being normal, pill money podz c.2025.",

Wiki Cat is a digital currency on the internet that aims to teach people about understanding and adopting cryptocurrencies. By introducing the world to cryptocurrencies in a light, fun and less serious manner, we believe more people can begin to learn more about this new and exciting type of financial system. Pancake swap Coinmarket cap Dexscreener FEATURES FAIR LAUNCH Wiki Cat was born on Sunday, 20 th March 2022, by Sir Mapy for his community called SMC DAO. It was created on the BNB network with a maximum supply of 1,000 trillion tokens. To ensure decentralization, the ownership of Wiki Cat has been renounced . LIQUIDITY To ensure a safe and reliable trading experience, the liquidity pool of Wiki Cat has been locked using the Unicrypt platform. This prevents anyone, including the owner, from accessing and removing the funds. You can buy and sell Wiki Cat with confidence, knowing that the liquidity pool is secure Tokenomics The tokenomics of Wiki Cat is simple and easy to comprehend. When you buy or sell Wiki Cat, a 2% tax is applied to each transaction. Of this tax, 1% goes to a burn wallet, permanently removing Wiki Cat from circulation, and the other 1% goes to the fee wallet, which funds the development of the ecosystem. PROJECT FUNDS WALLET 2% is added to the liquidity pool and the team wallet this allows the team to update the website and run marketing promotions. ROADMAP PHASE 1 WikiCat launch 500 holders 2,000 wallet Transactions Website launch Contract Auditing by solidity finance 1,000 organic telegram members White paper creation Road map creation FAQ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What is the Utility/Use Case for Wiki Cat? Wiki Cat started out as a token by Sir Mapy for the SMC community to teach them how to create meme tokens. Regardless, we believe the use case for Wiki Cat lies in the strength of its community that believes in the social consensus of shared value. This is what has taken the likes of Doge and Shiba Inu to billions of dollars in the market value. Who owns Wiki Cat? Wiki Cat ownership has been renounced . WikiCat is owned by the community. There is no CEO, no VC or board members pulling the strings in the background. For this reason, no wallet has more than 5% of the token. Funding or contributions are voluntary and ultimately the community gets to decide the future of the project. CONTRACT CHART AUDIT HOW TO BUY COPYRIGHT © WIKI CAT TOKEN, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED",

Aerodrome inherits the latest features from Velodrome V2. Aerodrome launched on 28th of August, 2023 on BASE network. Aerodrome Mechanics LOW SLIPPAGE FEES AERO EMISSIONS LIQUIDITY INCENTIVES LOW SLIPPAGE FEES AERO EMISSIONS LIQUIDITY INCENTIVES veAERO VOTERS TRADERS PROTOCOLS LP’s LOW SLIPPAGE FEES AERO EMISSIONS LIQUIDITY INCENTIVES LOW SLIPPAGE FEES AERO EMISSIONS LIQUIDITY INCENTIVES veAERO VOTERS TRADERS PROTOCOLS LP’s The protocol is designed to enable token swaps and generate fees (from Traders ) by attracting liquidity. Every epoch liquidity providers ( LPs ) receive $AERO token emissions proportionally to the votes the pools accumulate. Only staked (in the protocol gauges) liquidity receive emissions. Participants can lock their $AERO to be able to vote on the next epoch distribution of emissions, becoming veAERO Voters . veAERO Voters are rewarded (proportionally to locked amounts) for their votes with 100% of the protocol trading fees from the previous epoch and any additional voters incentives from the current epoch. An epoch is a 7-day period. It starts every Thursday at 00:00 UTC and ends Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. Votes, emissions, fees, and incentives are calculated for each epoch. Tokenomics Aerodrome Finance uses two tokens to manage its utility and governance: $AERO — ERC-20 utility token of the protocol $veAERO — ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT (non-fungible token) $AERO is distributed to liquidity providers through emissions. $veAERO is used for governance. Any $AERO holder can vote-escrow their tokens and receive a $veAERO (also known as Lock or veNFT) in exchange. Additional tokens can be added to the $veAERO NFT at any time. The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period, hence the ve prefix) can be up to 4 years, following the linear relationship shown below: 100 $AERO locked for 4 years will become 100 $veAERO 100 $AERO locked for 1 year will become 25 $veAERO The longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight) of the underlying locked balance. Additionally, Aerodrome Locks (veNFTs) can be set into Auto-Max Lock, which are treated by the protocol as being locked for the maximum duration of 4 years, and their voting power does not decay. The Auto-Max Lock feature can be turned on and off for each Lock (veNFT). Initial Distribution AERO Amount Percentage Voter Incentives 40M 8% Genesis Liquidity Incentives 10M 2% veAERO Amount Percentage Airdrop for veVELO Lockers 200M 40% Public Goods Fund (Auto Max-Locked) 105M 21% Foundation (Auto Max-Locked) 95M 19% Flight School (Auto Max-Locked) 50M 10% Emissions The initial supply of $AERO is 500M, with 450M distributed as vote-locked ( $veAERO ) tokens. Weekly emissions will begin at 10M $AERO (2% of the initial supply). The emission schedule will follow three phases: Take-off : During the first 14 weeks (epochs), emissions will increase at 3% per week, allowing for rapid growth in protocol activity and partner onboarding. Cruise : After Epoch 14, emissions will decay at 1% per epoch, ensuring total supply inflation decreases over time as the protocol matures. Aero Fed : When emissions programmatically drop under 9M per epoch, approximately Epoch 67, veAERO voters will take control of Aerodrome's monetary policy through the Aero Fed system. Voters will collectively make one of three choices each epoch: Increase emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized) Decrease emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized) Maintain emissions unchanged as a % of total supply The winning vote will be determined by simple majority vote. If an Increase or Decrease is selected, the emission rate will change one full epoch after the vote. A max emission rate will be set at 1% of total supply per week (52% annualized) and a minimum rate at 0.01% per week (0.52% annualized). Rebase $veAERO holders receive a rebase proportional to $AERO emissions and to the ratio of $veAERO to $AERO supply, reducing vote power dilution for $veAERO ! The weekly rebase amount is calculated with the following formula: rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalsupply)ˆ2 × 0.5 This rebase formula will reward $veAERO holders most when locking rates decrease, incentivizing new lockers to step in. $veAERO supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers. Projected Emission Schedule Note : projection below uses a 40% emissions lock rate and assumes Aero Fed keeps emissions constant . Emission Rewards Each epoch, $AERO emissions are distributed to liquidity pools proportionally to the $veAERO voting power the pools receive. Liquidity providers (LPs) can stake their LP positions to receive a share of the $AERO distributed to each pool proportionally to the size of positions and time staked. These rewards are distributed during the whole epoch and available for claiming as these accrue. Team Emissions While a fully autonomous and immutable protocol is an admirable objective, it comes at a cost. Aerodrome will ensure its long-term sustainability by employing a dedicated team focused on supporting the product decentralization, documentation, community, and ecosystem. To cover ongoing expenses and all the upcoming development efforts, 5% of the emissions will be going to the team address. *** \"Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare\" David Bowie Documentation Security Brand Kit Flight School Pool Launcher | Analytics Support | Website Mirrors 2025 © Aerodrome Finance v5.0.0+9a82e4 · Legal Disclaimer Legal Disclosures A public good for ● Base",
